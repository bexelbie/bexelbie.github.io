## About Me

I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the ancient beliefs that the horse is an all knowing messenger from powerful beings.
However, that simply isn't true.
It was inspired by a Dilbert Cartoon from 2015 and now no longer online.
In the cartoon Dilbert's boss tell's Dilbert to "stop being such a pessimist," to which Dilbert replies, "said General Custer to his horse."
When pressed for an explanation as to, "why would he talk to his horse," Dilbert points out that "even the horse knew something was wrong."
It's funny, at least to me.
I am not sure why.

That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you will ever otherwise find out.
Beyond my weird sense of humor and bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard.
I wear a bunch of hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:

* Product Manager with a focus on communities and upstream Linux
* American living in Europe
* "Student" of International Taxation

These days I am working for [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com) as a Product Manager in the Azure Core Upstream Linux Engineering Team.
I focus on helping Microsoft's contributions have meaning and impact on Community OS projects such as [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org).

I've written some code and contributed to other code bases.
A lot of this work has been done on [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie).

Talks and presentations that I've given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/).

More details can be found in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bexelbie), amongst other places.

If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll make this description better.

### bex

I tend to use the nickname bex.
It is written with no capital letters.
So far, I am the only male bex I have ever met.
Most other bexes are becks and it is usually short for Becky.
The world is an interesting place.

I tend to use the username bexelbie at most places where bex is not an option.

### Barbarism

I engage in one habit that a friend has described as "barbarism."
I put two spaces after periods.
\*gasp\*
I also tend to hardwrap non-email text.
\*shock\*
Finally, I have currently set my tab to be 4 spaces and not 8.
\*fainting noise\*

### GPG Key / Encrypted Communications

For those of you who need to send me something super sekrit, please think carefully.
While I used to have a GPG key, I no longer do.
I believe that email is [effectively not reasonable to secure with GPG](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html).
Therefore I encourage you to consider alternative methods, such as [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+19194148915).

### Rarely Quotable

I've had the privilege of being [quoted](/quoted) a few times.
For vanity reasons, I maintain a list.

### Quirky Bio

Brian "bex" Exelbierd enjoys a good beer, a nice coffee, and a rousing conversation about taxation.
Born in the USA, he now lives with his partner and daughter in Brno, Czech Republic.
When he has freetime, he tends to tinker with home automation, try to find the elusive double-chili/garlic bread from a local baker, and tinker with his thousands of spreadsheets.
He even still occasionally works on projects that are often "glue code" or the interstitial pieces that fill the spaces between systems.
By day he is a Product Manager at Microsoft for the Azure Core Upstream Linux Engineering team.

### Headshots

My sister-in-law, who is a great photographer, agreed to risk her reputation and take a new headshot for me.
I remain a terrible model, so be kind.
Here is me, circa July 2022.
