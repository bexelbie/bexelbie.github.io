## About Me

I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the ancient beliefs that the horse is an all knowing messenger from powerful beings.
However, that simply isn't true.
It is inspired, like many things, by a [Dilbert Cartoon](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-10/).
It's funny.
I am not sure why.

That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you will ever otherwise find out.
Beyond my weird sense of humor and bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard.
I wear a bunch of hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:

* Product Manager for Community Efforts and Derived Products
* Community Architect/Manager/Leader
* Software Engineer/Programmer
* Writer of Documentation
* American living in Europe
* "Student" of International Taxation

These days I am working for [Red Hat](https://community.redhat.com) as the Community Business Owner, a part of the RHEL Product Management team.
This weird title means I focus on helping Red Hat's strategy work well with our community OS projects, [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [CentOS](https://www.centos.org).
Today that means most of my focus is on [CentOS Stream](https://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOSStream).

I've written some code and contributed to other code bases.
A lot of this work has been done on [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie).

Talks and presentations that I've given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/).

![Fractal FM Logo](/img/fractal-fm_circle.jpg)

I've started a podcast, [Fractal FM](https://fractal.fm/)  with some friends, [give it a listen](https://fractal.fm/).

More details can be found in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcexelbi), amongst other places.

If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll make this description better.

### Barbarism

I engage in one habit that a friend has described as "barbarism."
I put two spaces after periods.  \*gasp\*
I also tend to hardwrap non-email text.  \*shock\*
Finally, I have currently set my tab to be 4 spaces and not 8.  \*fainting noise\*

### GPG Key / Encrypted Communications

For those of you who need to send me something super sekrit, please think carefully.
While I have a GPG key, I believe that email is [effectively not reasonable to secure with GPG](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html).
Therefore I encourage you to consider alternative methods, such as [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/bexelbie/).
I have a GPG key that has not yet expired that can be found in most key servers.
I haven't decided if I will be refreshing it when it expires.
GPG encrypted email is very time consuming for me to get decrypted and I will e slow to reply.

### Happiness

I know the folks behind [happinesspackets.io](https://happinesspackets.io) and have [received a few packets over the years](/happiness-packets).

### Rarely Quotable

I've had the privilege of being [quoted](/quoted) a few times.
For vanity reasons, I maintain a list.

## Bios and Headshots

Bios are hard to write and terrible to have to come up with on short notice.
I keep a few here for use.

Brian "bex" Exelbierd is the RHEL Community Business Owner and works to inform the RHEL roadmap with community efforts and to support Operating System communities.
At Red Hat, Brian has worked as a technical writer, software engineer, content strategist, community architect and now as a product manager.

Brian's background in software engineering stretches back years before his university work and includes stints in both business and government.
Many of his projects are the "glue code" or interstitial pieces that fill the spaces between systems, providing continuity and ease of use.
Follow his blog at www.winglemeyer.org.

### Quirky Bio

Brian "bex" Exelbierd enjoys a good beer, a nice coffee, and a rousing conversation about taxation.
Born in the USA, he now lives with his partner and daughter in Brno, Czech Republic.
His focus is on his family, walks for artisinal bread, and reading long form articles.
By night, he tinkers with this thousands of spreadsheets and occasionally works on projects that are often "glue code" or the interstitial pieces that fill the spaces between systems.
By day he is the RHEL Community Business Owner at Red Hat.
Follow him on twitter @bexelbie and read his sporadic blog pieces at www.winglemeyer.org.

### Headshots

I am placing two headshots here.
I have the photography skills of a &lt;insert unskilled thing here&gt; (I am a terrible picture taker, editor, and model), so be kind :).
I've also noticed that someone keeps running a real world shading effect on me so I appear to have more gray in my beard than these photos from 2013 show.
I am not sure why they are not auto-updating ...
