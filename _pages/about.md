## About Me

This blog takes its name from a quirky inspiration: a 2015 Dilbert cartoon where even General Custer‚Äôs horse knows trouble is ahead. For reasons I still don‚Äôt fully understand, this has always resonated with me. The domain name, on the other hand, stems from a practical choice‚Äîit‚Äôs an alias I‚Äôve often used in places like restaurants. I enjoy it because it feels simple, yet somehow just as perplexing as ‚ÄúExelbierd.‚Äù

Professionally, I wear multiple hats:  
- Product Manager specializing in open-source communities and upstream Linux.  
- American expat living in Brno, Czech Republic.  
- Enthusiast of international taxation and technology ‚Äúglue code.‚Äù  

Currently, I work at [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com), focusing on Linux distributions like [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org). My career blends strategic leadership with a passion for open-source collaboration.  

For code contributions, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie). Talks I‚Äôve given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/), and more professional details are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bexelbie).  

## Fun Facts
- **Nickname**: I go by "bex" (always lowercase). Most ‚Äúbexes‚Äù I meet are short for Becky‚Äînot Brian!  
- **Text Quirks**: I use two spaces after periods and hard-wrap text. Also, my tabs are set to 4 spaces instead of 8. Consider this your fair warning.  
- **Favorite Hobbies**: Artisanal bread hunting, long-form journalism, and tinkering with tech and home automation projects.

My sister-in-law, who is a great photographer, agreed to risk her reputation and take a new headshot for me.
I remain a terrible model, so be kind.
Here is me, circa July 2022.

## Encrypted Communications

While I previously used GPG for secure communications, I no longer find it practical for most purposes. Email encryption with GPG has significant usability and reliability issues, as highlighted in articles like [The PGP Problem](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html). Instead, I recommend using modern tools such as [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+19194148915) for secure messaging. If you have questions about secure communications, feel free to reach out.
