I'm a Principal Product Manager at [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com). I shape how Azure participates in upstream Linux communities like [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [Flatcar](https://flatcar-linux.org/). That's product strategy, community engagement, and making sure the company shows up responsibly in projects it depends on.

Before that, I wrote code, ran the open source program office's community work for Fedora, and worked in the RHEL business unit during a decade at Red Hat. Earlier careers included ISP infrastructure, financial analysis, tax preparation, university administration, and consulting. A path that makes more sense than it sounds.

I go by "bex" (always lowercase). It's usually short for Becky, not Brian, which keeps introductions interesting.

I'm an American expat in Brno, Czech Republic, living with my partner and daughter. Interests outside of work include coffee, long-form journalism, home automation, personal finance, international taxation, and writing glue code to connect things that were never meant to be connected.

Need a bio or headshot? [Bios & Headshots](/about/bios/) has you covered.

Comments are off. If something here sparks a thought, I'd rather hear it on your own blog or social media.

I use an LLM as an editing assistant. Rough drafts and voice transcripts go in, tighter prose comes out, then I do a final manual pass. The workflow is codified in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the leaner [STYLE-CAPSULE.md](../STYLE-CAPSULE.md).

This site reflects my personal views, not those of my employers, past or present.
