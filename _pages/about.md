## About Me

This blog is my digital home, now found at **bexelbie.com**. For years, it lived at *winglemeyer.org*—a domain that came from a practical choice. It’s an alias I’ve often used in places like restaurants, and I enjoyed it because it felt simple, yet somehow just as perplexing as my last name.

The blog’s subtitle, on the other hand, takes its name from a quirky inspiration: a 2015 Dilbert cartoon where even General Custer’s horse knows trouble is ahead. For reasons I still don’t fully understand, this has always resonated with me.

Professionally, I wear multiple hats:  
- Product Manager specializing in open source communities and upstream Linux.  
- American expat living in Brno, Czech Republic.  
- Enthusiast of international taxation and technology “glue code.”  

Currently, I work at [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com), focusing on Linux distributions like [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org). My career blends strategic leadership with a passion for open source collaboration.  

For code contributions, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie). Talks I’ve given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/), and more professional details are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bexelbie).  

## Fun Facts
- **Nickname**: I go by "bex" (always lowercase). Most “bexes” I meet are short for Becky — not Brian!  
- **Text Quirks**: I use two spaces after periods and hard-wrap text. Also, my tabs are set to 4 spaces instead of 8. Consider this your fair warning.
- **Favorite Hobbies**: Artisanal bread hunting, long-form journalism, and tinkering with tech and home automation projects.

My sister-in-law, who is a great photographer, agreed to risk her reputation and take a new headshot for me.
I remain a terrible model, so be kind.
Here I am, circa July 2022.

## Encrypted Communications

While I previously used GPG for secure communications, I no longer find it practical for most purposes. Email encryption with GPG has significant usability and reliability issues, as highlighted in articles like [The PGP Problem](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html). Instead, I recommend using modern tools such as [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+19194148915) for secure messaging. If you have questions about secure communications, feel free to reach out.  

## About This Site

This site is built with a few tools I appreciate. I write posts in Markdown and HTML, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) builds everything. The code lives in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie.github.io), and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) handles the hosting.

The design comes from the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme, and book cover images are courtesy of [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).

I've chosen to keep comments turned off for most posts, as I encourage responses on your own blog or social media. In the rare cases where comments make sense for an article, they are powered by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).

I use an LLM as an editing assist. I’ll dump a rough draft or a voice transcript in and have it help me tighten and clarify before a final manual pass. Sometimes it's smooth and sometimes it's a slog, but it has been net helpful. I’ve tried to codify the workflow in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the lean [STYLE-CAPSULE.md](../STYLE-CAPSULE.md) for one-off use.

For those who care, this site is my personal views and notes and not those of my employers, past or present.
