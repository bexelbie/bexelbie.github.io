## About Me

I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the ancient beliefs that the horse is an all knowing messenger from powerful beings.
However, that simply isn't true.
It was inspired by a Dilbert Cartoon from 2015 and now no longer online.
In the cartoon Dilbert's boss tell's Dilbert to "stop being such a pessimist," to which Dilbert replies, "said General Custer to his horse."
When pressed for an explanation as to, "why would he talk to his horse," Dilbert points out that "even the horse knew something was wrong."
It's funny, at least to me.
I am not sure why.

That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you will ever otherwise find out.
Beyond my weird sense of humor and bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard.
I wear a bunch of hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:

* Business Strategist with a focus on communities and developers
* American living in Europe
* "Student" of International Taxation

These days I am working for [Red Hat](https://community.redhat.com) as a Business Strategist in the Red Hat Enteprise Linux Business Unit.
I focus on helping Red Hat's strategy work well with our Community OS projects, [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) and [CentOS](https://www.centos.org), and Developers in general.
I also spend quite a bit of time thinking about the unpaid Linux market overall.

I've written some code and contributed to other code bases.
A lot of this work has been done on [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie).

Talks and presentations that I've given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/).

More details can be found in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcexelbi), amongst other places.

If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll make this description better.

### Barbarism

I engage in one habit that a friend has described as "barbarism."
I put two spaces after periods.  \*gasp\*
I also tend to hardwrap non-email text.  \*shock\*
Finally, I have currently set my tab to be 4 spaces and not 8.  \*fainting noise\*

### GPG Key / Encrypted Communications

For those of you who need to send me something super sekrit, please think carefully.
While I used to have a GPG key, I no longer do.
I believe that email is [effectively not reasonable to secure with GPG](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html).
Therefore I encourage you to consider alternative methods, such as [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+19194148915).

### Happiness

I know the folks behind [happinesspackets.io](https://happinesspackets.io) and have [received a few packets over the years](/happiness-packets).

### Rarely Quotable

I've had the privilege of being [quoted](/quoted) a few times.
For vanity reasons, I maintain a list.

### Headshots

My sister-in-law, who is a great photographer, agreed to risk her reputation and take a new headshot for me.  I remain a terrible model, so be kind.  Here is me, circa July 2022.
