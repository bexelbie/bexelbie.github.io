Bios are hard to write and terrible to have to come up with on short notice.
I keep a few here for use.

## Quirky Bio

Brian "bex" Exelbierd is happiest debating the finer points of international taxation over a good coffee. An American expat in Brno, Czech Republic, he balances life as a Linux strategist, home automation tinkerer, and dad. By day he shapes how Microsoft Azure participates in upstream Linux. He spent the previous decade doing similar work at Red Hat. When not reading too much long-form journalism, he writes glue code to connect things that were never meant to be connected.

## Short Bio

Brian "bex" Exelbierd is a Principal Product Manager at Microsoft, where he shapes Azure's upstream Linux strategy and is the product manager for Flatcar Container Linux. Previously, he spent a decade at Red Hat in roles spanning development, the open source program office, and the RHEL business unit. He lives in Brno, Czech Republic.

## Medium Bio

Brian "bex" Exelbierd is a Principal Product Manager at Microsoft, where he shapes how Azure participates in upstream Linux communities like Fedora and Flatcar. That's product strategy, community engagement, and making sure the company shows up responsibly in projects it depends on. Before Microsoft, he wrote code, ran the open source program office's community work for Fedora, and worked in the RHEL business unit during a decade at Red Hat. He's an American expat in Brno, Czech Republic, where he lives with his partner and daughter.

## Headshots

My sister-in-law, who is a great photographer, agreed to risk her reputation and take a headshot for me.
I remain a terrible model, so be kind.
Here I am, circa July 2022.
