It’s OK to Push Back: Just know why you’re doing it

Earlier this year I wrote about stopping cookie licking in my own life.  An extension of this came up recently in a conversation with a friend of mine.  He was trying to set up a day’s adventure with me, my partner, his partner, and him.

He and I were chatting on Telegram.  My partner has the app as well and she was in the group were were talking in.  Unfortunately his partner doesn’t have Telegram.  She is a WhatsApp user.  Needless to say, it isn’t easy to coordinate four adults when only three of them can see the messages and the odd-person out isn’t even in the same room as one of the others.

He proposed a simple solution, my partner and I should just join a WhatsApp group.  The problem is, I’m not using WhatsApp anymore[^1].  In the past I would have reinstalled the app and joined the room.  In this case, I pushed back.  After a moment’s hesitation he suggested Facebook Messenger, which works out better for everyone and is actually more convenient for one of the Telegram users.

## Pushing Back isn’t bad

When you push back on a request, you’re not saying “no.”. Instead you’re making it clear that you’d like to explore other options.  However, and this is key, you’re also saying that if we can’t find an option that works, the answer might be “no.”

When you go into the conversation, you need to understand why you’re pushing back and what your goals are.  Remember, you’re not saying “no,” you’re opening negotiations.

In the situation above, I was looking to continue work on reducing the number of messaging apps I use. A few months ago, around the time of the cookie post, I looked at all of the messaging apps on my phone and tried to figure out which ones I actually used.  It was easy to identify the one I used the most. One, SMS/iMessage is essentially built in and not really relevant to an evaluation.  For the rest it was much harder.

I started really looking at the history[^2] in each app.  Had anyone written me in the last year? The last 6 months? Who? Why? Was I likely to write them again?

I found out that I had three kinds of people in this list:

### New Phone, who dis?

These people wrote me, often 6 months or more ago, specifically for one event, transaction, or situation.  I wasn’t likely to write them again or if I did it would be in a year when the event/situation rolls around again.  I figured for these folks, “losing” them wasn’t a big challenge because a) we were never really “connected;” and b) in a year they may have changed their communication patterns entirely.

### I am your everything

These folks are connected to me via multiple methods.  They have some magical algorithm that helps them figure out where they will write me next.  I don’t feel bad about reducing their choices.  They can still get to me easily in an app I know they use and I get to delete an app I don’t use.

### You Complete Me

I found a few people, often people who I value talking too who only use this one app.  In a few cases I asked, and they really said this was all they used.  They’ve made a choice.

It’s OK to have limits and you shouldn’t feel bad about that.  You also should
