 You received a Happiness Packet from Amita (amsharma@redhat.com). Your Happiness Packet contains:

    Honestly Bex, your first impression was not so good for me. I thought you are way too straight forward. But more I started working with you in Open Source world, more I started understanding your work style. You are an amazing contributor who is capable of addressing very challenging issues in Open Source and Fedora. With your great amount of knowledge and fast learning capabilities, within a short amount of time, you have not left any area of Fedora untouched. I see you handling very hot topics with an ease in different Fedora meetings. You are an awesome contributor whom I look at as a very senior and experienced person. I learn a lot from you. I wish to work with you more closely in future, under your wings in Fedora. Thanks for taking initiatives and changing things for right in Fedora. I wish more strength and power to you all the time so that you will never go away from Fedora :)
