#1000Words - A "daily" writing exercise

Before you commit to this, make some realistic decisions. If you
aren't going to do what you're outlining, don't commit to it so that
you set yourself up for failure. If you wanted to run a Marathon and
you currently are sedentary you wouldn't try to do it by running 1/2 of
a Marathon every day. So, with the bad analogies out of the way, this
is how I defined it and some stretch goals.

Basic Guidelines:

Write every working day. This means I don't write on weekends, holidays, vacations, etc. Interestingly, I have occasionally felt like I wanted to write on those days, and that was fantastic. However, I judge myself on writing on every working day.

Write 1000 unedited words. The words do not need to be polished. I am somewhat of a stickler for spelling, so I correct that as I notice it. I do not re-read, proofread, or otherwise review the writing at the time of creation. Specifically, and much to @lproven's disgust, I don't fix typographical grammar errors like your/you're and their/there/they're.

Almost any writing counts. Sometimes I write what I am feeling, like a journal entry. Sometimes I write out pros/cons of a decision I am weighing. Sometimes I write a plan for something I need to accomplish. I don't think a "to do" list should count. It needs to be writing. Writing in my case is defined as text which requires thought/planning. Using this logic, writing a blog post or article for work counts. Writing a presentation counts.

When in doubt, stick to the spirit of the exercise. If your editor counts numbers in a list like this as words either suck it up and move on, or write a few extra words. If you're in doubt, that probably means you are either a) overthinking this or b) feeling guilty because you're trying to cheat. Don't cheat yourself.

Stretch Goals:

Review your work after a few weeks. Was it something you're happy with? What is it like to read? Could you edit some of it and polish it into a blog post?

Get a set of writing prompts and try to push yourself. My initial goal was just to actually write. 1000 words seemed massive (and still does some days). I didn't know if I could actually do it in a reasonable amount of time. I have found it typically takes me between 15 and 30 minutes. I also wanted to improve my writing "muscle". My ability to just sit down and do it. I am not a highly creative person in the sense that I struggle for topics, therefore I have not tried to do one specific thing, like write a novel or write blog posts. Instead, I want to just get writing. Focusing it even further can come later. I liken this to my desire to ride a bike. Until I can actually ride for 30 minutes, it is pointless to decide if I can bike to work. (PS: Look at me stretching the word count here :P)

Unrelated blog idea: I believe that in sentences like the one above, emoji should count as punctuation. I think this is also true for urls. Perhaps this is a logical approach to English grammar.

Consider participating in a writing challenge. A common one is the NaWrMo (spelling) - the national writing month (or something like that). They set a target of approximately 1500 words every day for a month to write a novel. Consider adapting this to meet your needs. If the novel is 1500 words every day in a 30 day month, it is only 6 weeks for every working day assuming no vacations or holidays. Stretching that a bit more, it is only 9 weeks if you scale back to 1000 words.
I haven't done any of my stretch goals yet. I am still just cranking along under basic guidelines and still struggling a bit as yesterday shows.

I will say that this is like exercise. I started this on a Friday and wound up writing over that weekend. The next week was full of decisions and thoughts around a potential new role at work, which made the writing easier. That weekend I didn't write and on Monday, wow that shit was hard to restart. This parallels my experience with some basic exercises. I had gotten into a groove of doing some very basic exercises while Dominika showered. Then I got a little sick and stopped, and boom, zero resumption. sigh
