Matthew came over and told me 'bout RPM
It's the Fedora packaging format
Bundles up our applications
Best we've ever had

And I asked him if I should try to do it
And if so how do I go about making one
It seems awfully scary
I am not sure I can do it

So we laughed
Compared notes
We had a talk
We sent some email
He pointed me to the wiki
I packaged DayJournal
I packaged DayJournal

I searched around for an app to package
It was hard because Fedora is so complete
I found an app that I needed
DayJournal is that app

And so I opened a Bugzilla
I got started with review
Which only lasted a little while
Igor and Neal were of great help to me

And we laughed
At the world
They can have their (dot) .debs
And we'll have our RPM
I packaged DayJournal
I packaged DayJournal

I packaged DayJournal
It was easy
It didn't take that long
A package won't change the world
But I'm so glad,
I packaged DayJournal

And we laughed
At the world
They can have their (dot) .debs
And we'll have our RPM

I packaged DayJournal
For the first time
I packaged DayJournal
And I may do it again!
I packaged DayJournal
I packaged DayJournal

I packaged DayJournal and it was easy
It was just like typin' make
But yeah, I packaged DayJournal
A package won't change the world
But I'm so glad I
Packaged DayJournal
I packaged DayJournal
I packaged DayJournal
