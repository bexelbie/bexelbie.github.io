A few months ago, around the time of the cookie post, I looked at all of the messaging apps on my phone and tried to figure out which ones I actually used. It was easy to identify the one I used the most. One, SMS/iMessage is essentially built in and not really relevant to an evaluation. For the rest it was much harder.

I started really looking at the history[^2] in each app. Had anyone written me in the last year? The last 6 months? Who? Why? Was I likely to write them again?

I found out that I had three kinds of people in this list:

### New Phone, who dis?

These people wrote me, often 6 months or more ago, specifically for one event, transaction, or situation. I wasn’t likely to write them again or if I did it would be in a year when the event/situation rolls around again. I figured for these folks, “losing” them wasn’t a big challenge because a) we were never really “connected;” and b) in a year they may have changed their communication patterns entirely.

### I am your everything

These folks are connected to me via multiple methods. They have some magical algorithm that helps them figure out where they will write me next. I don’t feel bad about reducing their choices. They can still get to me easily in an app I know they use and I get to delete an app I don’t use.

### You Complete Me

I found a few people, often people who I value talking too who only use this one app. In a few cases I asked, and they really said this was all they used. They’ve made a choice.

It’s OK to have limits and you shouldn’t feel bad about that. You also should

Most people I know socially are on Whatsapp, if anything. Only Apple users can use iMessage so that's out for all Android users. Signal is the company standard and it's a horrid app that regularly loses all my messages and contacts. WA & Signal don't work in proper clients, e.g. Pidgin.
So Telegram is my preferred one, but nobody in SUSE is on it, for example, and there's a big FOSS world backlash against it for its home-rolled (poor) crypto which isn't on by default for group chats. In vain do I point out that a rich client for it takes 20MB of RAM rather than a gig for an embedded Chrome instance for Signal.

I feel ya - I have the same problems, different apps

So currently I have to use: SMS; iMessage; FB Messenger; Telegram; Signal; Google Hangouts; Skype. Viber I keep around for now but I think my 1 contact on it doesn't use it any more.
BB Messenger I will kill off soon as Blackberry are killing it, which is a shame as it is the only internet messenger 1 person uses and I like chatting with her -- and she and her partner put me up whenever I'm in London.
