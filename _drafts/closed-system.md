In January, I watched ["Lifting the Fog on Red Star
OS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGDM9exlZw), a presentation
by Florian Grunow and Niklaus Schiess, about the North Korean Linux
Distribution, Red Star OS. The operation system features many
safeguards and protections. They represent a real attempt at virus
control and other facets of computer protection.

The OS also includes functionality for tracing all files created or used
on the system. This allows North Korea to create a completely closed
information system. They know where every file originated and where
it has been distributed too. It is obviously very big brother feeling
and goes way beyond the big brother systems we are used to in the
west, such as TinEye that only index publicly accessible files.

But I don't want to talk about information control. Instead I started
thinking about closed systems more generally and more specifically
about economically closed systems.

The interrelated nature of economic systems is something that hasn't
completely "gelled" in my mind. For example, if a country is at
war, how can it fail for economic reasons? I can understand running
out of munitions, mat√©riel or people. I can't really understand how
an economic failure could lead to a failure of the war effort.

Taken in a more generic direction, what happens if you construct a
closed economic system? I am defining a "closed economic system"
as one with no external connections. No external trade, import,
export, etc. Obviously you're going to have some limitations. The
big ones are that you can only consume what you can produce and
that you have only the resources available to you in the system.
If you're not near the ocean you're going to have severe limits on
the number of fish you have. Even if you farm grow them, you're
going to be species limited. You're also potentially only a  small
number of natural disasters away from starvation. However it is
only a relatively modern phenomena for this to not generally be the
case.

If you're willing to accept these limitations, is the economy
doomed to fail?  Common wisdom seems to be that the economy will
fail, people will starve, etc. Is this a question of the definition
of failure? In other words, if you are OK with not having a quality
of life that is identical to another economy, are you then in a
situation where you are always succeeding?

Is the real problem with these systems the governance trade-offs
that have to be made?  For example, you can't afford to have excess
workers. You also can't afford unchecked population growth that
outstrips resources. You have to dedicate a certain amount of your
workforce to production and not advancement/research. Many of these
are rules which those of us growing up in the "free world" would
bristle at our outright object. But again, if these things are OK,
is the economy doomed to fail?

Which brings us back to North Korea. Their economy is essentially
closed as they have almost no real trading partners. Their economy
is generally considered a failure. Repression is always part
of the reasons cited for this failure. Is the challenge that a
society that makes the choices a closed economic system requires
can never be allowed to be free because of the discovery that the
rest of the world doesn't make these choices?  In other words, if
North Korea could completely seal it's borders and cause it's people
to forget that there were options to do anything different, would
it succeed?  Would it succeed if you removed the central mis-management
that drives the economy?  Does a closed economy require central
management?
