Recently someone close to me lost a family member. This tragedy surfaced a new way (to me) that technology affects the act of remembrance. 

We’ve had photos for a long time. These can capture a moment in time to show how someone looked. Occasionally a story about the person or even part of their personality is captured in these homemade photos. More often than not, I suspect, the photos mostly trigger the (re)telling of stories. 

For almost as long (as long?) as we’ve had photos we’ve had the ability to make homemade recordings of relatives. For children of a certain age have had much of their childhood video recorded on various mediums. With planning these can capture entire moments, stories and personality. However it can also create a bulk of material that is not well indexed, searched or easily used for remembrance. 

I realized during this incident how important the “live photos” that some mobile phones can capture are. Because so many photos of the deceased were made with an iPhone, there are a ton of small movies, complete with sound, to provide context for a photo. The photos themselves are easily reviewed and shared because they are all “in the palm of your hand.” The small movies they provide the context right before and after a photo can reveal so much. Was that smile practiced or forced? Was it the result of everyone trying to stop laughing and “be still” or was there a moment of awe that turned into that selfie or group photo. What was being said at that restaurant table or how did they unwrap that gift. 

When Apple introduced Live Photos, my first time hearing about them, I dismissed them as a gimmick or something they would have limited use for me. I’d never realized how evolutionary this technology might be. These small memories provided touchstones during the beginning of the grieving and remembrance process. I’m ready to start looking at mine more critically to see what memories are worthy of greater reflection in these moving images.
