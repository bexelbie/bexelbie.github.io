I've read that people from different cultures observe the world in measurably different ways. For example, as I recall, individuals from "eastern" cultures place more emphasis on looking at the background portion of a picture than those from "western" cultures who tend to focus only on the foreground or focal point. 

I wonder if this explains the driving patterns too. It isn't that the lines are suggestions in some countries, as the joke goes. Instead we see drives centering on the line because in this activity driving in the lane would be using the negative space.
