As you may remember from [part I](https://fedoramagazine.org/fcaic-in-the-house/) I became the cake-man (that's FCAIC or Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator) about 3 months ago.  I'm writing today to update you on what I've been working on relative to my goals and to invite you to help me make it all so much better.  I'd also like to share some ideas about where to go from here.

# How'd I do?

I listed four goals in part I:

* Get to know the community
* [Budget.Next](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Budget.next)
* FOSCo (and FAmSCo)
* Fedora Docs Publishing

## Get to know the community

As I mentioned before, this is a never-ending goal.  I keep meeting amazing people focused on areas of the project which were not on my contribution radar before I became FCAIC.  Passionate, intelligent and helpful people who have real insights and experience have helped me so much in my first few months.  I look forward to continuing to rely on them and hope that my contributions back have been helpful to them too.

As part of this goal I attended both FUDCon LATAM and FUDCon APAC.  These two events were held at local universities in Puno, Peru and Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  It was great to see how our contributors break down Fedora for these kinds of audiences.  I also learned a lot about LATAM and APAC and how they fit into Fedora.  As an American living in the Czech Republic I had a fairly good appreciation for NA and EMEA, but more on that later.

I've discovered there are some challenges in those regions and that we need to make sure we are doing the right things.  Some of it is just resourcing and some of it is working through culture on all sides to get people talking.

In the next few months I will be [DevConf.cz](https://devconf.cz/) and [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/).  Fedora will have a strong presence at both conferences and I am looking forward to interacting with our Ambassadors and other attending contributors.  I will be focused on several activities, including contributing to the [Diversity FAD](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Diversity_2017) taking place during DevConf.cz and other meetings around Fedora topics.  At FOSDEM I have the fantastic opportunity to help make the [Distributions devroom](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/distributions/) happen with the world-famous [Brian Stinson](https://twitter.com/bstinsonmhk) from [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/).

If you're going to be near me, let me know so we can meet and say "hello." I'll endeavor to keep my travel schedule on the Fedora vacation calendar so you can find me when I'm not at home.

## [Budget.Next](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Budget.next)

As you know, Budget.Next is the project to change the way Fedora manages money.  I've been working hard with the regional treasurers and credit card holders to put together a system that will meet our needs.  Without data we can't make decisions.  Data has been inconsistent in the project and the regions and we have worked together to fix this.  More details are being posted in a longer article here on the Fedora Community Blog, the short version is that we have:

1. Built a data storage system using [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/), a plain text accounting system that has been [packaged](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/ledger/) in Fedora for a while.
2. We've written some basic reports to show the overall data and position for our project and the regions.
3. Rebuilt the [budget website](https://budget.fedoraproject.org/) to display all the information.

This is still a work in progress and I am sure we have a lot of lessons to discover as we move through this fiscal year.  I am very excited about having data on demand and being able to move the conversation forward from discussing numbers to discussing impact.  I could not have done this without the help of the regional treasurers and credit card holders and the support so many others.  I know that together we can make this process seamless and a model for other organizations that want to be transparent about their finances.

## FOSCo (and FAmSCo)

The [Fedora Ambassador Steering
Committee](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Ambassadors_Steering_Committee)
(FAmSCo) and some great folks have been working on creating a new
body to increase coordination of our outreach efforts. In this case,
outreach means our user-facing and focused messaging and components,
and the same for our contributor components.

To that end, they began working on the [Fedora Outreach Steering
Committee](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FOSCo) (FOSCo). Originally
envisioned as a successor organization for FAmSCo, it appears that after
a lot of work, it has been discovered that FAmSCo still has a lot of
useful work to do and shouldn't be disbanded.

I've been working with several folks in FAmSCo on various proposals. I
think we are getting closer and think we will be able to charge the new
body soon. It also sounds like FAMSCo will be able to take the opportunity
to focus on the Ambassadors program in greater depth because some of
its coordination duties will now be shifted to FOSCo.

## Fedora Docs Publishing

I've been involved in the new docs publishing tool chain. You have
read some of my previous blog entries about the conversations we had at
[Flock](https://flocktofedora.org/) this year. I've also written a bit
about possible implementations.

I have a personal goal of us having a new publication solution by Fedora
26. I believe a lot of the docs community is on board with this objective
as well.

I also have a dream that the new publication system can allow us to have
an easier time publishing all kinds of other docs such as the Diversity
Inbox and various sub-project materials. I am positive more information
will be forthcoming soon.
