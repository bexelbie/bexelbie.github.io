<p>I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the ancient peoples belief in the horse as an all knowing messenger from all powerful beings.  That simply isn't true though.  Honestly, it is inspired, like many things, by a <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-10/">Dilbert Cartoon</a>.  It's funny.  I am not sure why.</p>

<p>That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you will ever otherwise find out.  Beyond my weird sense of humor and bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard.  I wear a bunch of hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Software Engineer/Programmer</li>
    <li>Writer of Documentation</li>
    <li>University Recruiter</li>
    <li>Student of tax/bookkeeper</li>
    <li>American living in Europe</li>
</ul>

I've had the privilege of giving some talks:
<ul>
    <li><a href-"/2016/02/02/configmgmtcamp/">Nulecule: Packaging, Distributing & Deploying Container Applications the Cloud Way</a> @ <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu">Config Management Camp EU 2016</a> - 2 Feb 2016</li>
    <li><a href-"/2016/03/03">Atomic Developer Bundle: Containerized Development Made Easy</a> @ <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2016">CentOS Dojo, Brussels 2016</a> - 29 Jan 2016 and @ <a href="http://devconf.cz">DevConf.cz 2016</a> - 6 February 2016.  Both talks were presented with co-presenter <a href="https://www.twiter.com/swordphilic">Navid Shaikh</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2015/10/19/devops-docker-talk/">Getting to DevOps with Docker</a> @ <a href="http://devstars.cz">DevStars.cz</a> - 19 Oct 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>More details can be found in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcexelbi">LinkedIn profile</a>, amongst other places.  If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll make this description better.</p>
