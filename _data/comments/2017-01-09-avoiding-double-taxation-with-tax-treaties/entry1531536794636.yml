message: "These are opinion more than answers. 1. If the income is in fact of a 1099 form then I check it, otherwise, no. 2.  No, Each treaty article needs it's own form.\r\nHere is a list of the incomes , articles, protocols etc. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/Tax_Treaty_Table_1.pdf   3. This flow chart might help. I tend to err on the side of caution; https://www.tax-charts.com/charts/6114.pdf    4. No idea...   5.  Probably not. While the treaties seem to recognize foreign taxes, they do not necessarily recognize foreign tax deductions. Example, In Canada, qualified capital gains are taxes on only 50% of the gain. The USA will tax on 100% of the gain.  6. Yes, there is a way and it's not on the 1116. I can't remember where it  is. That is exactly what I was looking for when I came across your site. 7. Yes, you do calculate it back in again.  You did a great job on this article :)"
