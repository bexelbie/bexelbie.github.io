message: "Well done, thanks!  I've been bashing my head against these re-sourcing treaties for months now.  You've confirmed that I'm on the right track... but I think I need to do this 8833, and that's a whole other mess.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty absurd how difficult this is.  I'm taxed in Sweden.  My marginal tax rate is 62%.  My income is simple.  My tax bill in the U.S. is *obviously* $0, but the amount of work it takes to prove that... holy cow.\r\n\r\nAlso, you apparently can't e-file with the IRS's freefilefillableforms.com (the IRS's best attempt to sound like a late-night infomercial) when you re-source capital gains, because you are supposed to attach an extra statement to your return if you re-source \"other foreign taxes paid or accrued\", and their system doesn't allow attachments.  The instructions also don't say what your statement is supposed to... well... state.\r\n\r\nI pay my taxes in Sweden by texting 'ja' when they text me their calculation.  Takes 3 seconds."
