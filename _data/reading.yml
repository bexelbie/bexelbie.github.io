      Wow. I really enjoyed the book. I can’t imagine how a tv series does it justice, so I assume it is a related story that is also good. Beyond the premise, the book weaves together elements of Chinese history I am ignorant of. Seeing events which I was aware of cast in a different light.
      
      This book and the subsequent wait for the hold on the second one to get filled also were significant. Not because the periods were long, it was only a few weeks, but because it finally represented a form of the “slow” movement I could comprehend. I wrote about this more when [I blogged about starting this page](/ramblings/2025/02/11/rediscovering-reading/).

      Ellie Mystal connects a lot of dots through an African American lens I need a guide for. I found the additional context around things I knew, or blindly accepted, fascinating. This is also a very interesting read when set against the second Trump administration’s horrifying start. I’m putting his second book on my list to read.

      This was a slow read, I started it in October 2024. The book was tough to feel super engaged with and felt like it drifted around a bit laconically and was a bit repetitive feeling. I can’t help but wonder if this was heavily edited or had a lot of ghost assistant writers who stuck to their chapter and didn’t consider the whole book. It may also represent the output of a distractedly busy executive. Either way, it was good to hear what Satya thought (thinks?) Microsoft can be. It puts the internal conversations around Diversity and Inclusivity in context. And, despite being dated, shows how strong the company has been at executing on a Cloud and AI strategy.

      The third in the MurderBot Diaries, a return to the feelings of the first book. Definitely distracting me from reading other things.

      The second of the MurderBot Diaries, this one felt like it was suffering a bit from “middle book syndrome.” It was still a great read and definitely helpful for the larger story arc I’m expecting, but definitely slower at times.

      The first of the MurderBot Diaries, it was a rollercoaster of a read. Light and delightful I binge read it in essentially one day.

      The premise of this time management text is cute. However, by the second or third chapter I was tired of cute hamster references. The book wasn’t helped by covering material I already knew. It wasn’t a bad book, but definitely not for me. It did teach me it’s ok to not struggle through the end of a book that isn’t working.

      The book started a bit slow as I felt like we abruptly changed gears. It was worth reading, but definitely had places where it seemed to drag.  It isn't clear to me what the third book will pick up from that is relevant.
      <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.add('revealed')">The abandonment of basically all of the original characters, less one I think the author likes because they're a trope, combined with Chinese names that make it hard for me to remember them all was tough.  to settle in.  To be clear, I don't want the characters to have Western names.  I love the setting and the ability to see China and concepts like a political cadre from a new perspective.  I also really like the multi-generational force ideas allowed for by the introduction of hibernation, however making them exclusively the heroes feels a bit heavy handed.</span>
