I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the
ancient beliefs that the horse is an all knowing messenger from
powerful beings. However, that simply isn't true. It is inspired,
like many things, by a [Dilbert
Cartoon](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-10/).  It's funny. I am
not sure why.

That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you
will ever otherwise find out. Beyond my weird sense of humor and
bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard. I wear a bunch of
hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:

* Software Engineer/Programmer
* Writer of Documentation
* American living in Europe
* "Student" of International Taxation

I've written some code and contributed to other code bases.  A lot
of this work has been done in [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie).

Talks and presentations that I've given are collected in [my talk,
presentation and demo
archive](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie-talks-demos).

More details can be found in my [LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcexelbi), amongst other places.

If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll
make this description better.
