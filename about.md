# About Me

I'd like to be able to say this blog draws its name from the ancient beliefs that the horse is an all knowing messenger from powerful beings. However, that simply isn't true. It is inspired, like many things, by a [Dilbert Cartoon](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-10/).  It's funny. I am not sure why.

That first paragraph probably told you more about me than you will ever otherwise find out. Beyond my weird sense of humor and bad taste in music the rest is pretty standard. I wear a bunch of hats professionally and semi-professionally, including:

* Community Manager/Leader
* Software Engineer/Programmer
* Writer of Documentation
* American living in Europe
* "Student" of International Taxation

These days I am working for [Red Hat](https://community.redhat.com) as the [Fedora](https://www.fedoraproject.org) community's [Action and Impact Coordinator](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/fedora-project/council/fcaic.html).

I've written some code and contributed to other code bases.  A lot of this work has been done in [GitHub](https://github.com/bexelbie).

Talks and presentations that I've given are collected on my [talks page](/talks/).

More details can be found in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcexelbi), amongst other places.

If anyone actually reads this page and sends me a question, I'll make this description better.

## Barbarism

I engage in one habit that a friend has described as "barbarism."  I put two spaces after periods. \*gasp\*  I also tend to hardwrap non-email text. \*shock\*  Finally, I have currently set my tab to be 4 spaces and not 8. \*fainting noise\*

## GPG Key

For those of you who need to send me something super sekrit, you can use my spiffy GPG key.  Please keep in mind that my response time on
encrypted emails is pretty slow.

Fingerprint: `CE92 EA39 3146 3300 34BC AA49 8473 3A2D BF0C AA95`

You can find my full key, [here](https://keybase.io/bexelbie/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=ce92ea393146330034bcaa4984733a2dbf0caa95).

## Happiness

I know the folks behind [happinesspackets.io](https://happinesspackets.io) and have [received a few packets over the years](/happiness-packets.html).

## Rarely Quotable

I've had the privilege of being [quoted](/quoted) a few times.  For vanity reasons, I maintain a list.

# Bios and Headshots

Bios are hard to write and worst to have to come up with on short notice.  I keep a few here as notes.

## Headshots

I am placing two headshots here.  I have the photography skills of a &lt;insert unskilled thing here&gt; (I am a terrible picture taker, editor, and model), so be kind :).  I've also noticed that someone keeps running a real world shading effect on me so I appear to have more gray in my beard than these photos from 2013 show.  I am not sure why they are not auto-updating ...

# About This Site

This web site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from my [bexelbie.github.io](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie.github.io) repository.

The site is authored in a combination of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is built by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  The site makes use of the [jekyll-paginate](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) and [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) plugins.

The theme is the official [jekyll version](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) of the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).  The theme has been modified by me with several patches and extensions.  They can be reviewed in the site's source repository.  I also maintain a ["stable" branch"](https://github.com/bexelbie/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) with all my changes, both private and those are are submitted for upstream consideration.

Comments are only occasionally enabled.  I think that most of my writing deserve a response via your own blog/social media and I encourage you to do so.  In a few situations I've enabled comments because they make sense for that particular article.  Comments are powered by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).

Reading times are roughly calculated using a reading speed of 180 words per minute.  The code is from [Carlos Alexandro Becker](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/jekyll-reading-time-without-plugins/).
