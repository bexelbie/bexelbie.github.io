Diet cake this week ...

# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- I had a bunch of meetings and flailed around in my email.  Not every week is exciting, fun or dramatic :).  The week was also very short because I returned from OSCAL in Albania on Monday and lost a day to travel.

# A la Mode

- As a human I took some holiday (vacation) and was not at work on Friday or the first half of Monday (today).  I got to see beautiful Cluj-Napoca, Romania and relax :).

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Open Source Summit in Tokyo, Japan from 31 May - 2 June.
- LinuxCon in Beijing, China from 19-20 June where I am helping to host the Fedora/CentOS/EPEL Birds of a Feather.
- Working from Gdansk, Poland from 3-4 July.
- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
