# A slice of cake

In the last week as FCAIC I:

- Attended the LATAM organizational FAD.  It was a fantastic opportunity to work with a group of ambassadors and to share what I know.  My biggest take was ideas that I want to cross-pollinate with other parts of the project.  Read more in my event report which will be posted today or tomorrow.
- Continued working on Flock.  In particular most of the air travel is now booked. I will be working with the funding committee to release the final funding we can provide this week.  I've also gotten additional information from the CfP committee and sent final submission notices.

# Ã€ la mode

- Posted this late as I needed about 12 hours of sleep to recover from a flight :(.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
