During the Easter holiday my travel included segments on trains by
two different companies and on buses by two different companies.
Each company has it's own method of managing tickets, services,
delays, and connections.  Some feel better than others, but none
are truly wrong or broken.  None of these processes had as many
steps as traveling through an Indian airport.

When you travel in India, you quickly learn that traveling  through
an Indian airport is a study in processing. Roughly you go through
the following:

1. ID check against your itinerary at the entrance of the airport.
   Literally, the entrance.

2. In some airports all of your bags are then screened by x-ray.

3. Get your boarding card and drop off your checked luggage.
   Generally, if you present your itinerary they do NOT check your
   ID.  If there are kiosks, print your own boarding card and go
   to the bag drop.  At this point you must also get a luggage tag
   for each carryon bag and attach it. You do not need to fill out
   the tag.

4. If you're bag is overweight you have to take an overweight receipt
   to a separate counter, pay, and then return to get your boarding
   card. This may involve crossing a checkpoint.  They won't care
   that you are the only person in the airport and that they watched
   you the whole time.

5. Go to security. To enter the screening line show just your
   boarding card, no ID.

6. A guard supervises your putting your carryon bags on the security
   scanner belt.  They will rearrange bags, look in bags, and
   generally makes sure things are in order.  Laptops are removed.
   Laptops are placed in separate bins and you are given a bin claim
   tag.  In all other ways, the bags are screened as expected.  The
   luggage tag on your carryon should be stamped after it is screened.

7. Walk through a magnetometer, separated by gender. 

8. Step on to a platform where you get a light pat down and hand
   metal detector wanding. At this point your boarding card is stamped
   twice with an ink stamper.

9. Collect your carryon bags and make sure you have a stamp on the
   luggage tag.

10. At some airports you have to show your tickets and luggage tags
    to a guard to verify they are stamped before you can leave
    security.

11. Go to your gate. 

12. Approach the gate and give your boarding card to the agent.
    Keep your portion.

13. Show your stamped boarding card and your stamped luggage tags
    to a guard before you can enter the jet bridge.

14. Fly. 

It is a long and involved process, however it is clear that their
priority is verifying every passenger and bag, not constantly
re-checking ID. The focus on safe flights and not unrelated law
enforcement issues is refreshing. The process is multi-layered,
verified multiple times, and transparent. To top it all off, there
is no screaming or yelling. The guards are rigid in thought and
process but polite in word.

There are definitely security holes, but that is true of every
screening process. This process is easier when you have low labor
costs. However, I think it is practical and could work in the US.
That said, I don't think Americans could trust a process that doesn't
involve rude employees, constant document checks, and inconveniences
like shoe removal.

The big mystery to me is how come the Indian flying public is not
covered in ink smears.  The stamps used are wet ink stampers and
the tickets and tags are all mostly waterproof so the ink smears
and takes a long time to dry.  Perhaps this inconvenience would be
enough to satisfy the American flying public.
