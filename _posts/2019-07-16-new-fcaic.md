<p>I’ve decided to move on from my role as the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator (FCAIC).&nbsp; This was not an easy decision to make.  I am proud of the work I have done in Fedora over the last three years and I think I have helped the community move past many challenges.&nbsp; I could NEVER have done all of this without the support and assistance of the community!<br></p>

<p>As some of you know, I have been covering for some other roles in Red Hat for almost the last year.&nbsp; Some of these tasks have led to some opportunities to take my career in a different direction.  I am going to remain at Red Hat and on the same team with the same manager, but with a slightly expanded scope of duties.&nbsp; I will no longer be day-to-day on Fedora and will instead be in a consultative role as a Community Architect at Large.  This is a fancy way of saying that I will be tackling helping lots of projects with various issues while also working on some specific strategic objectives.<br></p>

<p>I’ve decided to move on from my role as the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator (FCAIC).&nbsp; This was not an easy decision to make.  I am proud of the work I have done in Fedora over the last three years and I think I have helped the community move past many challenges.&nbsp; I could NEVER have done all of this without the support and assistance of the community!<br></p>

<p>As some of you know, I have been covering for some other roles in Red Hat for almost the last year.&nbsp; Some of these tasks have led to some opportunities to take my career in a different direction.  I am going to remain at Red Hat and on the same team with the same manager, but with a slightly expanded scope of duties.&nbsp; I will no longer be day-to-day on Fedora and will instead be in a consultative role as a Community Architect at Large.  This is a fancy way of saying that I will be tackling helping lots of projects with various issues while also working on some specific strategic objectives.<br></p>

<p>I think this is a great opportunity for the Fedora community.&nbsp; The Fedora I became FCAIC in three years ago is a very different place from the Fedora of today.&nbsp; While I could easily continue to help shape and grow this community, I think that I can do more by letting some new ideas come in.&nbsp; The new person will hopefully be able to approach challenges differently.  I’ll also be here to offer my advice and feedback as others who have moved on in the past have done.&nbsp; Additionally, I will work with Matthew Miller and Red Hat to help hire and onboard the new Fedora Community and Impact Coordinator.  During this time I will continue as FCAIC.<br></p>

<p>This means that we are looking for a new FCAIC. Love Fedora? Want to work with Fedora full-time to help support and grow the Fedora community? This is the core of what the FCAIC does. The job description (also below), has a list of some of the primary job responsibilities and required skills – but that’s just a sample of the duties required, and the day to day life working full-time with the Fedora community.<br></p>

<p>Day to day work includes working with Mindshare, managing the Fedora Budget, and being part of many other teams, including the Fedora Council.&nbsp; You should be ready to write frequently about Fedora’s achievements, policies and decisions, and to draft and generate ideas and strategies.  And, of course, planning Flock and Fedora’s presence at other events. It’s hard work, but also a great deal of fun.<br></p>

<p>Are you good at setting long-term priorities and hacking away at problems with the big picture in mind? Do you enjoy working with people all around the world, with a variety of skills and interests, to build not just a successful Linux distribution, but a healthy project? Can you set priorities, follow through, and know when to say “no” in order to focus on the most important tasks for success? Is Fedora’s mission deeply important to you?<br></p>

<p>If you said “yes” to those questions, you might be a great candidate for the FCAIC role.
