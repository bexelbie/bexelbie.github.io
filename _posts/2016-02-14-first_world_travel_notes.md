Traveling, especially alone, gives you lots of time to observe the
world and see many "first world" problems:

1. James Taylor's opus, "Sittin' By the Dock of the Bay," while
catchy, is not appropriate plane boarding music.

2. Airlines have lots of options with recorded safety briefings.
The animated ones are the most disturbing and funny. The live action
plus CGI ones are the most captivating.

3. If your doing your safety briefing in more than two languages
it is definitely time to start being more choosy. In flight
announcements in three languages are obnoxious no matter how you
do it.

    If you are making announcements in only two languages, your
    primary working language and a second language, have the same
    person make both announcements back to back.  Hearing the English
    language announcement on Emirates and knowing the one person
    who speaks Arabic will be making an announcement with just
    enough of a delay to cause your movie to pause twice and skip
    a section is aggravating.

4. Making a ton of announcements about how you don't make announcements
is self-defeating. If you're going to play the "quiet airport" game,
use signs.

5. When you clean an airplane, it always looks nice to leave all
the seat belts buckled and laying tight across the seats. It looks
orderly.  However, this is also a BAD idea.

    Remember, you already don't trust the users of these belts to understand
    how they operate. It is already too much to expect them to read
    numbers and letters from their boarding card, understand them,
    find the right seat, put their stuff in an overhead bin and sit
    down all while not blocking and aisle, bitching, or hurting
    themselves or others. You really want to add the complication
    of making them figure out a seat belt before you explain it?[^1]

The usual rants about bad airport signage, extra BS security screening and security theater, lack of free wifi or BS limits on it, and unprepared people have been deliberately omitted.
