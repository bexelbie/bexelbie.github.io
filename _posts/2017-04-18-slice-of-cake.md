A day late because of holidays celebrated locally.

# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- Read the great [conversation](
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/council-discuss@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RJQWWPGDVBXPNHP6KGISKYY74CZH47UQ/) going on around the proposed new Fedora Mission statement.  Taken in context with our [Foundations](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations), I believe this mission will let us focus on building a platform for amazing things!
- Continued to watch the Flock hotel contract work its way to completion.  Soon my pretty!
- OMG the paperwork and administrivia.

# A la Mode

I also made some personal progress doing:

- Submitted a [patch](https://github.com/mquinson/po4a/pull/25) to po4a to allow for key-value paragraphs to go through the text filter without getting munged.
- I finished the monstrous task of washing, air drying, ironing, and replacing a couch cover along with all of the matching cushion covers.  Ikea - you really can take it apart and spend a lot of your time futzing with it.  As the Polish say, *Masakra*.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Back to Beantown (Boston, MA USA) for Red Hat Summit from 2-5 May.  If you're in the neighborhood, you know the deal.
- Community Leadership Summit in Austin, TX from 6-7 May and OSCON is also in Austin, TX from 8-12 May. I may have to leave on 12 May early for ...
- OSCAL in Tirana, Albania from 13-14 has accepted a talk proposal from me (eep!) so definitely come and give me some audience love.
