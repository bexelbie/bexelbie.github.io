![The Wine Cellar](/img/2016/wine/cellar.jpg){: .align-center}

This past weekend I had the opportunity to
visit the [National Wine Cellar of the Czech
Republic](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/en/salon-vin/salon-vin-ceske-republiky/).

The cellar is located in the basement of [Chateau
Valtice](http://www.czechtourism.com/c/valtice-chateau/),
part of the UNESCO listed [Lednice-Valtice
Complex](http://www.czechtourism.com/c/lednice-valtice-area-unesco/).
It is a beautiful chateau style "castle" complete with gardens,
ponds, and horse-drawn carriage rides.  Honestly, the [Lednice
Chateau](http://www.czechtourism.com/c/lednice-chateau/)
appears to be in better physical shape as Valtice has
opted to go heavy on vino-tourism.  They have produced a nice
[brochure](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/download/nvc-brozura-salon-vin-150x150mm_en-aktualizace%202016.pdf)
that summarizes the various wine regions of South Moravia and the cellar.

The cellar, created as part of the [National Wine
Centre](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/en/), has over [100 wines on
site](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/en/salon-vin/vina-v-salonu/) for
tasting and purchase.

Yes, for tasting.  The cellar offers several tasting experiences.  Some
are guided and restricted to certain wines selected by sommeliers. Others
are open tastings.  Our group chose an open wine tasting where we could
make our own choices and request guidance when desired.  Tastings start
at 100 CZK (~$4) for 16 wines in a guided experience and go all the way
up to the top-level open tasting for 499 CZK (~$21)

A tasting experience consists of a glass to use for tasting and some bread
to cleanse the pallet.  Glass cleaning stations are provided throughout
the cellar and there are containers to dispose of unneeded wine.
At least I assume that is what they are for.

Let me be very clear on this next point.  If you are reading this and
thinking you will get some specific wine guidance, stop reading now.
I am more of a "drinker" than a "taster" and I was mentally unprepared
to have over 100 wines available for tasting.

I reiterate, I was mentally unprepared for over 100 open bottles
(properly sealed and temperature controlled, but open for tasting)
along with descriptions, charts, graphs, and lists of prizes won.
Our tasting was a 90 minute open tasting.  90 minutes, 100 wines, 399
CZK (~$17).  You cannot "catch them all."  However, if you choose to
visit, and I highly recommend that you do, prepare and have a game plan.
To help you, the cellar has free wifi and an online application to track
your tasting notes.

When I first started drinking wine, I fell in love with Rieslings.
I have since expanded my tastes, however, these days I tend to drink
more beer than wine.  Most of the wines at the beginning of the cellar
are Rieslings.  I did not make a point of drinking each of them. As it
seemed to early to commit to that at the beginning of the tasting.

Once I got started I thought, this isn't too bad, I'll taste a little from
each bottle.  By about wine 5 that fell apart.  Around wine 15 I realized
I had no idea what I was doing and that I hadn't even found the reds yet.
Finally, somewhere around 45 minutes in, I decided to try to find and
compare wines with the same grape and different levels of barikové
(Czech for 'barrique' which is apparently French for 'oakiness').
I did this because I realized I needed a mission or things were going
to go off the rails.  I did not do this because of my particular love
or hate of oak.

Comparing oakiness was fascinating.  This
caused me to find wines [74 - Zweigeltrebe barrique
2012](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/en/salon-vin/vina-v-salonu/?idV=6074)
and [75 - Zweigeltrebe barrique
2012](http://www.vinarskecentrum.cz/en/salon-vin/vina-v-salonu/?idV=6075).
No, that is not a typo.  Yes, they have the same name.  No, I don't
know why.  They vary in three things, as far as I can tell:

- Residual Sugar - 74 has 2.7 g/l and 75 has 2.1 g/l

- Acidity - 74 has 5.3 g/l and 75 has 5 g/l

- Number of stickers on the bottle - 74 has one and 75 has three.

I am sorry I don't have a picture of the bottles.

They also taste radically different.  74 has a level of sweet that seems
to overshadow other tastes.  The level of oak also differs ... hmm.
Four of the five us liked 75 much more than 74.  The fifth person was
probably drunk.

While I wouldn't have minded having some guidance during the journey,
there was some fun to be had in being very free-spirited.  There was a
sommelier, however it wasn't clear if he spoke English.  Two of our group
did get some guidance from him near the end and found two wines they
adored.

After my adventure in oakiness, I looked for the most expensive wine.
I regret now that I didn't look for the least expensive.  If I have the
opportunity to return, I plan to try and stick to a single variety and
see if I can determine what drives my tastes in wine.

It was great to see the quality wines available in the Czech Republic
on display.  Wine making is an old art here, but it was [nearly lost under
Communism](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/world/europe/czech-wine-moravia.html?_r=0).
This may also explain why a lot of the wines I find in the store are
not raved about.  The wine makers are really rediscovering the
art and we haven't seen it trickle all the way down to the Tesco yet.

At the end of the day, after we had tried countless wines (one person
who claims they counted said they sampled 29 wines), we purchased a total
of four bottles.  The bottles are pictured below.  The only thing I know
for sure about them is that one of them is still in my home.[^0]  I am sorry.
I failed at wine tasting while having fun doing it.

No trip into an old chateau cellar is complete without some scary electrical wiring.
