# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- Fixed a bug in the display of inflows on budget.fedoraproject.org
- First rounds of Flock Funding offers sent - more coming soon
- Finalized my part of the arrangements for the upcoming LATAM Organizational FAD

# À la mode

- Enjoyed two days of public holidays.
- Learned to properly spell "À la mode" thanks to [Jean-Baptiste Holcroft](https://jibecfed.fedorapeople.org/blog/).

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- LATAM Organizational FAD from 13-15 July in Cusco, Peru.
- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
