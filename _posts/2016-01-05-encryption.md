[Several governments](http://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-seeks-to-reframe-encryption-debate-1451417252) want to put [back doors[(https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/encryption-balance-2015-review) into encryption systems.  The goal is to be able to provide safety by being able to read messages sent by "terrorists".  They promise to safeguard the back doors so that only they can use them. They also promise not misuse the access.

Lots of folks don't believe them.  Lots of folks know that an encryption system with a backdoor is inherently insecure.  Lots of folks know that a backdoor can be used by the bad guys as well as the good guys.  Lots of folks are trying to convince the public this is important.  Lots of folks are, in my opinion doing this the wrong way, by trying to provide reasoned logical arguments and education.

The public has made it clear that fears about safety trump everything, even the truth. The public doesn't like reasoned logic and education. The public has shown a shockingly low opinion of the need for privacy. The public is pretty much convinced only the "guilty" have anything to "hide," or that they are so unimportant as to ever be a target of a government, bad guy or a back door attack.

To convince the public, we need bigger "guns." We need Puff Daddy. 

### "It's All About The Benjamins" - Puff Daddy

I believe there are two money-based arguments to make.

## To the public I say:

There are two kinds of safes in the world:

A) A safe only the owner has the key too.  The key cannot be copied and has so far proven to be unable to be duplicated.  The only way for someone to open the safe is with the key.

B) A safe only the owner has the key too.  The key cannot be copied and has so far proven to be unable to be duplicated.  However, in the back of the safe is another door with a numeric keypad.  The government has a code to open the safe without anyone's knowledge.  They claim no one else can know the code or guess it.  They have no legal obligation to tell anyone they opened the safe or if they added or removed anything.

You're an insurance company and you insure valuables against theft.  If things go missing from a safe, you have to pay to replace them unless you can prove that the owner took them or that they weren't stolen (i.e. they were taken by a third party legally).  Will you provide insurance on Safe A?  Safe B?

I won't insure Safe B.  The government can remove everything in a completely undetectable way and never have to admit it.  I will potentially pay a lot of claims for things that weren't actually stolen (assuming the government had authority to take them).

With Safe A, unless someone has figured out how to duplicate the key I know the contents were taken by the owner.  Case closed, no payout.  If the key is able to be duplicated there is a tiny window of opportunity for theft while all the safes are re-cored with new locks and keys.

Even if this idea works, it probably isn't enough to end this debate quickly.  We need a second set of big guns, lobbyists.

## To the financial industry lobbying groups I say:

My credit card agreement gives me effectively 100% protection from fraudulent charges. To have this freedom from liability I only need to abide by this condition:

### "[I] must take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorized use of [my] Card, Access Checks and Account." - Capital One

Credit card companies should know that mandatory encryption back doors mean that SSL, TLS, and other encryption tools used in the pipeline to process both in-person and telephone/internet card transactions are inherently insecure. This opens them up for virtually unlimited liability.  This liability could be avoided by adding more verification steps, however, if credit cards require even more verification, people will simply stop using them[0] and where possible either revert to checks or just re-embrace cash. People are fundamentally lazy and won't want the extra hassle.

Another way to avoid liability is to make it the card holder's problem by making it unreasonable to have faith in a system with a known back door. Obviously this is a non-starter. Therefore the merchants would have to be made liable. Also a non-starter.

The only real solution is for the industry to keep the back door from happening in the first place.

When lobbying groups are threatened they fix the laws. In this case we all win.

I read, but cannot find the link, that US Banks had dismissed SMS verifications as "flaky" despite them being highly reliable in many other parts of the world.
