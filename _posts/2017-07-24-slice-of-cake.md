# A slice of cake

In the last week as FCAIC I:

- Lots and lots of Flock work.  We are up to over 45 people receiving some form of funding or other travel assistance, including visa letters.
- Worked Robert Mayr on some Mindshare ideas.  This is exciting stuff and you should get involved.
- Did I mention the Flock work? :)

# Ã€ la mode

- Attended a wedding this weekend in Poland.  Survived :P.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
