This sentiment, which I agree with, caused me to think of all of those other "great years" we have been talking about.  These are years like, **The Year of the Linux Desktop**.

Therefore, I not so humbly submit this small list of years.

2016 - [The year of understanding science](https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/683681888687538177)

2017 - The year of great conference Wi-Fi

201X - [Great Recurring Task rewrite](https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/TW-235) of [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org)

202X - The year of the Containerized Desktop

204X - The year of the Linux Desktop

20XX - The year I actually work only 40 hours a week

Which years did I miss?
