Better late cake than no cake!

# A slice of cake

This week as FCAIC I:

- Lots of work toward the new Fedora Budget website.  I need to still send some emails to the fedora-website group, but we are doing budget-level internal reviews.  Want to see a sneak peek, visit [here](http://209.132.179.16:3000/).  And, yes, I know there are some CSS issues.  Want to help out?
- Preparing for my US trip (see below) which involved lots of triaging.

# A la Mode

I also made some personal progress doing:

- Submitted CZ taxes to my preparer (no this never gets old).
- I've been doing even more thinking about data security and backup as I prepared my electronics for travel.  This series I want to write is getting longer.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling:

- 19-25 March: I'll be traveling to Boston, MA for a staff meeting. If you're around, ping me.
