# A slice of cake

In the last week as FCAIC I:

- So much Flock with the fantastic help of Kristyna, Jen, Stephen and the entire team.
- Docs work continues onward.  We should begin the staging this week.

# Ã€ la mode

- Finally moved my homedir and parts of my setup to a new F26 laptop.  So far my compose key is broken and my sadistic need to only do setup via Ansible is slowing me down :).

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
