# A slice of cake

In the last week as FCAIC I:

- Lots of Flock planning.  I believe over 45 people have some level of funding for travel that needs planning.  Specifically airfare is complete and hotels are complete.  Bus tickets in progress.
- Fedora Docs AsciiDoc+AsciiBinder test site launched, see the [announcement](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/docs@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/7QCQS6JWXB7ZGKYOKLYYZYRYOE7RAZSF/) for details and information on how you can help and provide feedback.

# Ã€ la mode

- I am looking for some help designing a header graphic for these posts.  My entire ability to do graphical work is contained in this word, "none."  Interested in helping?
- I actually got to my own personal paperwork and bookkeeping, hooray!

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
