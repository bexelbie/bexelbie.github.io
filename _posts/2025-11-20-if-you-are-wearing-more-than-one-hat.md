excerpt: Navigating competing roles in open source - why clarity about which hat you're wearing matters.

If you're wearing more than one hat on your head something is probably wrong. In open source, this can feel like running a haberdashery, with a focus on juggling roles and responsibilities that sometimes conflict, instead of contributing. In October, I attended the first [OpenSSL Conference](https://openssl-conference.org) and got to see some amazing talks and, more importantly, meet some truly wonderful people and catch up with friends.

> Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft on upstream Linux in Azure and was formerly at Red Hat. These reflections draw on roles I've held in various communities and at various companies. These are personal observations and opinions.

Let's start by defining a hat. This is a situation where you are in a formalized role, often charged with representing a specific perspective, team, or entity. The formalization is critical. There is a difference between a contributor saying something, even one who is active in many areas of the project, and the founder, a maintainer, or the project leader saying it. That said, you are always you, regardless of whether you have one hat, a million hats, or none. You can't be a jerk in a forum and then expect everyone to ignore that when you show up at a conference. Hats don't change who you are.

During a few of the panels, several panelists were trying to represent multiple points of view. They participate or have participated in multiple ways, for example on behalf of an employer and out of personal interest. One speaker has a collection of colored berets they take with them onto the stage. Over the course of their comments they change the hat on their head to talk to different, and quite often all, sides of a question. I want to be clear, I am not calling this person out. This is the situation they feel like they are in.

I empathize with them because I have been in this same situation. I have participated in the Fedora community as an individually motivated contributor, the Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator (a paid role provided to the community by Red Hat), and as the representative of Red Hat discussing what Red Hat thinks. Thankfully, I never did them all at once, just two at a time. I felt like I was walking a tightrope. Stressful. I didn't want my personal opinion to be taken as the "voice" of the project or of Red Hat.

This experience was formative and helped me navigate this the next time it came up when I became Red Hat's representative to the CentOS Project Board. My predecessor in the role had been a long-time individual contributor and was serving as the Red Hat representative. They struggled with the hats game. The first thing I was told was that the hat switching was tough to follow and people were often unsure if they were hearing "the voice of Red Hat" or the "voice of the person." I resolved to not further this. I made the decision that I would only ever speak as "the voice of Red Hat."[^1] It would be clear and unambiguous.

But, you may be thinking, what if you, bex, really have something you personally want to say. It did happen and what I did was leverage the power of patience and friendship.

Patience was in the form of waiting to see how a conversation developed. I am very rarely the smartest person in the room. I often found that someone would propose the exact thing I was thinking of, sometimes even better or more nuanced than I would have.

On the rare occasions that didn't happen I would backchannel one of my friends in the room and ask them to consider saying what I thought. The act of asking was useful for two reasons. One, it was a filter for things that may not have been useful to begin with. Two, if someone was uneasy with sharing my views, their feedback was often useful in helping me better understand the situation.

In the worst case, if I didn't agree with their feedback, I could ask someone else. Alternatively, I could step back and examine what was motivating me so strongly. Usually that reflection revealed this was a matter of personal preference or style that wouldn't affect the outcome in the long term. It was always possible that I'd hit an edge case where I genuinely needed a second hat.

I recognize this is not an easy choice to make. I had the privilege of not having to give up an existing role to make this decision. However, I believe that in most cases when you do have to give up one role for another, you're better off not trying to play both parts. You're likely blocking or impeding the person who took on the role you gave up. If you have advice a quiet sidebar with them will go further than potentially forcing them into public conversations that don't need to be public. Your successor may do things differently, you should be ok with that. And remember what I wrote above, you're not being silenced.

So when do multiple hats tend to happen? Here are some common causes of hat wearing:

1. When you’re in a project because your company wants you there and you are personally interested in the technology.
2. You participate in the project and a fork, downstream, or upstream that it has a relationship with.
3. You participate in multiple projects all solving the same problem, for example multiple Linux distributions.
4. You sit on a standards body or other organization that has general purview over an area and are working on the implementation.
5. You work on both an open source project and the product it is commercially sold as.
6. You're a member of a legally liable profession, such as a lawyer (in many jurisdictions) so anything you say can be held to that standard.
7. You're in a small project and because of bootstrapping (or community apathy) you're filling multiple roles during a "forming" phase.

This raises the question of which hat you should wear if you feel like you have more than one option. Here's how I decide which hat to wear:

1. Is this really a multi-hat situation? Are you just conflicted because you have views as a member of multiple projects or as someone who contributes in multiple ways that aren't in alignment? If it isn't a formalized role you're struggling with the right problem. Speak your mind. Share the conflict and lack of alignment. This is the meat of the conversation.
2. Why are you here? You generally know. That is the hat you wear. If you're at a Technical Advisory Committee Meeting on behalf of your company and an issue about which you are personally passionate comes up - remember patience and friendship because this is a company hat moment.
3. If you are in a situation where you can truly firewall off the conversations, you can change to an alternative hat. What this means is when you find yourself in a space where the provider of your other hat is very uninvolved. For example, if you normally work on crypto for your employer, but right now you are making documentation website CSS updates. Hello personal hat.
4. If you're in a 1:1 conversation and you know the person well, you can lay out all of your thoughts - just avoid the hat language. Be direct and open. If you don't know the person well, you should probably err on the side of being conservative and think carefully about states 1 and 2 above.

Some will argue that in smaller projects or early-stage efforts the flexibility of multiple roles is a feature, not a bug, allowing for rapid adaptation before formal structures are needed. That's fair during a "forming" phase - but it shouldn't become permanent. As the project matures, work to clarify roles and expectations so contributors can focus on one hat at a time.

As a maintainer or project leader, when you find people wearing multiple hats, it's a warning flag. Something isn't going right. Figure it out before the complexity becomes unmanageable.

[^1]: In the case of this role it meant I spent a lot of time not saying much as Red Hat didn't have opinions on many community issues preferring to see the community make its own decisions. Honestly, I probably spent more time explaining why I wasn't talking than actually talking.
