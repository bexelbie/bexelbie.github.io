Roughly to the tune of [I Kissed a Girl](http://jillsobule.com/2012/01/i-kissed-a-girl/) by [Jill Sobule](https://twitter.com/jillsobule).

[Matthew](https://mattdm.org/) came over, and told me 'bout [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager)<br/>
It is a packaging format he said<br/>
[Apps](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/) install so easily<br/>
It simplifies admin's lives<br/>

And I asked him if I could really build one?<br/>
How to get started and what tools do I need?<br/>
Does he have any tips or advice for me?<br/>
It seems awfully scary<br/>

So we laughed<br/>
Compared notes<br/>
We had a talk<br/>
We sent email<br/>
He sent me to the [wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers)<br/>
I [packaged](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/dayjournal/) an app<br/>
I packaged an app<br/>

I searched around for an app that's neat<br/>
It's hard because Fedora's so complete<br/>
I found an app that I need<br/>
[DayJournal](https://burnsoftware.wordpress.com/dayjournal/) it will be<br/>

I opened a [BZ](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1409884)<br/>
Started with spec review<br/>
But it only lasted a little while<br/>
[Igor](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ignatenkobrain) and [Neal](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ngompa) were great mentors for me<br/>

And we shared<br/>
With the world<br/>
They can have their snaps and debs<br/>
And we'll have our RPM<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>

I packaged DayJournal<br/>
It was easy<br/>
It didn't take me that long<br/>
A package, it won't change the world<br/>
But I'm so glad,<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>

And we shared<br/>
With the world<br/>
They can have their snaps and debs<br/>
And we'll have our RPM<br/>

I packaged an app<br/>
For the first time<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>
You should `dnf install` it now<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>

I packaged an app, it was easy<br/>
It was just like typin' make<br/>
But yeah, packaged DayJournal<br/>
A package, it won't change the world<br/>
But I'm so glad I<br/>
Packaged an app<br/>
For the first time<br/>
I packaged DayJournal<br/>
