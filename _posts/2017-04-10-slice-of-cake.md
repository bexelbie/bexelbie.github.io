If this was any fresher off the press, it'd be a [flatcake](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Flatcake).

# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- The Fedora Council FAD report really is posting this week! Look for it on the [Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/).
- GSoC applications closed on Monday so I've been dealing with last minute wiki access requests and then preparing everything for student selection.
- I wrote a PO requisition ... and it wasn't horrible.  It's exciting that [Fedora is a sponsor for the openSUSE conference](https://twitter.com/openSUSE/status/849252526524424194).
- Lots of exciting email between the Fedora Community Treasurers, Credit Card holders, and me.  The [budget files](https://pagure.io/fork/bex/fedora-budget/blob/master/f/FY18/ledger) should be updated soon.

# A la Mode

I also made some personal progress doing:

- I learned that the [České dráhý](http://www.cd.cz), the Czech rail company, has an online store that won't sell group tickets for more than 6 people directly.  You also can't buy more than 5 people on a group ticket at the window.  WEIRD!
- I was able to find a taxi company in [Zaječí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaje%C4%8D%C3%AD) online despite not being able to spell Zaječí twice in a row the same way.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Back to Beantown (Boston, MA USA) for Red Hat Summit from 2-5 May.  If you're in the neighborhood, you know the deal.
- Community Leadership Summit in Austin, TX from 6-7 May and OSCON is also in Austin, TX from 8-12 May. I may have to leave on 12 May early for ...
- OSCAL in Tirana, Albania from 13-14 has accepted a talk proposal from me (eep!) so definitely come and give me some audience love.
