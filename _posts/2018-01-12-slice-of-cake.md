# A slice of cake

Last week as the FCAIC I:

- Lots of expense processing. Really, the start of the year should be lighter :D
- Talked with another community AsciiBinder, our documentation engine as they may adopt it as well
- A bunch of meetings that got compressed into the smaller week, including one about Modular Documentation

# Ã€ la mode

- I was away from 6-9 January so I got less done than normal.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.
