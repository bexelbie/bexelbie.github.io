There are lots of reasons to decline a meeting invitation ... honestly, way more reasons to decline than to accept.  Regardless of your criteria, there will come a time when you need to look back on the meetings you missed to get recordings to watch or survey the wreckage.

At work we use Google Calendar and I have always been frustrated that my choices were to see decline events littering my calendar or to have to follow the frustrating procedure of:
- Make 5 clicks to enable showing declined events
- Navigate back to the dates of interest
- Make 5 more clicks to disable showing declined events

But friends, there is now a better way!

That's right.  Some kind soul at Google added this to the display menu in the top-right of the calendar.  I found it by accident so you don't have too.
