This entire rant may get invalidated by a single comment from
an English friend, however, I suspect it won't.

I was recently reading an article,
["How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed
campaign"](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign)
by Rafael Behr in The Guardian.  I am told that The Guardian was not in
favor of leaving the European Union.  This quote struck me:

> "Polls showed that many voters were unaware that a remain vote was the
party’s official position, a confusion exacerbated by Jeremy Corbyn’s
manifest ambivalence about the entire **European project**."

I've bolded the words "European project."

[Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/project)
defines the noun form of project as:

1. a specific plan or design :  scheme
2. obsolete :  idea
3. a planned undertaking: as
   1. a definitely formulated piece of research
   2. a large usually government-supported undertaking
   3. a task or problem engaged in usually by a group of students to
     supplement and apply classroom studies

None of these definitions encompasses my understanding of the European
Union.  I read this and I think that connotatively we tend to use the
word project with two meanings:

* Project meaning a hobby.  A project is often something you're doing
  in your spare time in your garage.  It can be like a kit-car or an
  interest in sculpting garden gnomes.  You do it and either aren't
  really committed and could drop it tomorrow or are very committed and
  embarrassed by the level of commitment.

* Project as an assignment that you may or may not agree with and that
  may still be canceled or superseded.  A project at work isn't something
  your company does all the time.

By constantly referring to the European Union as the "European project"
the British are seeming to voice their constant non-commitment.
This language isn't new and based on my little bit of research seems to
be uniquely British.  I feel like people have been sitting around in the
UK for years saying cute things like, "Oh yes, Bob, in addition to being
your Uncle, is very dedicated to the 'European project', 'tis such a pity
to see him tilting at windmills like that.  Crumpets, crumpets, corgis
and the Queen."  Ok, so they probably don't say that or use air-quotes
around the words, but this is what I imagine.

They say language shapes our beliefs.  If this is true then BRExit
makes more and more sense.  The commitment was never terribly strong.
There was always a distance.  I wonder how British people react if they
read articles that explicitly say the "European Union" or "our membership
in the European Union."  Does this stronger language make the connection
seem stronger to them.  Does it make it harder to rationalize withdrawing
amongst those in favor of leaving?

So UK'ers am I completely misinterpreting your British English?  Is it
bad that I wanted to write "English English" there?

PS: This is not an attempt to turn this small collection of my ramblings
into a solely BRExit based blog.  It just happens that these two topics
came up in a row.
