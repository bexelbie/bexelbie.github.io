Many of the New Year’s resolutions I hear about are focused on doing more.  Weight loss, exercise, saving money, eating healthy, or whatever - the focus is on doing something more than you used to do.

I am not a resolution maker.  You could say I am resolute in this position[^1].  However, while working on year-end activities, I realized I could resolve to do less in order to do more.

Every month I have a list of tasks that I work on.  They range from sharpening our kitchen knives to downloading the PDFs of my bank statements.  I’m old school and still save all of my statements.  Because it is a the end/beginning of the year, some extra stuff needs to happen to start preparing for taxes.

While doing this, I realized that there are a bunch of tasks I do monthly that provide me no value on a monthly basis.  For example, while I do want to save my bank statements, does it matter if I do it every month or every year?  They aren’t going to time out that fast, if ever.

So my less is more effort is going to focus on figuring out what I can do less frequently, or not at all.  I’ll start by shifting monthly activities to quarterly and then see what happens.

What can you do less of?
