My five year old and I do the New York Times' [Strands Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) almost every morning on the tram to drop her off at school.  She can't read yet, so I solve the puzzle in my head and then tell her the words and spell them letter by letter for her to tap out on my phone.  This is a great daddy-daughter bonding experience, kills some time on the tram, and, as a bonus, let's me explain some aspects of English language usage to her which she won't generally get in our Czech-first environment.

I routinely share the game results with some friends.  She has learned to do this and adds her name to the end to show she did the tapping.  One day she asked if she could make up her own version to share with the friends.  Here it is for you to enjoy too.
