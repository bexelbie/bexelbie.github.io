**tl;dr:** No one cares enough to try and make your phone slow on purpose
to get you to buy a new one.[^0] This has probably been said before, but
it got under my skin today.

A friend of mine on Facebook recently liked a post about an Internet
petition[^1].  The petition was calling for Apple to stop releasing code
that deliberately slowed down older phones.  This code, they claimed,
was designed solely to force users to buy new phones every three or
four years.  They think this is wasteful and that a phone should last
a lot longer.

A lot of "ink" has been spilled on this topic before, but for some reason
it crawled under my skin today.  Here is my take on this:

Dear Poster,

Do you work in IT or with software? I ask because I do and I form my
opinions based on my experience there. For reference, it has been
my experience with other fields that things that seem illogical and evil
to me turn out to not be. For example, cooking mystifies me because the
recipes seem to be very dictatorial while the practitioners all seem to
be freestyling.[^2]

But back to IT. In general there are two kinds of updates: security
fixes and new features.

- Security fixes usually don't add a lot of new requirements for
  CPU cycles, memory, storage, or power. They just close a hole or fix a
  bug.

- Features on the other hand, often require more resources. Even features
  that look simple, like the solarized-style screen coloring in the
  latest iOS, can add resource demands. These are going to make your
  old device feel slower.

One conclusion you can draw from this is that one way to extend the
life of devices is to only make security fixes. This should reduce any
additional resource requirements to a minimum.  You'll still suffer from
the inevitable decline of battery life, but your handset shouldn't slow
down because of the Operating System. But, see below about apps.

However, as the poster's experience with her Android mobile shows[^3],
most manufacturers won't do this. The primary reason is that phone
makers only get paid when you buy the phone, not for the software
updates. Because there is no money in phone software updates most
companies won't do it.[^4]

Apple, in my opinion, does an amazing job of pushing out updates for old
phones. The folks behind the Android operating system also do a great
job making security updates available. However, unlike Apple, which is
both the software maker and phone manufacturer, the Android folks only
make the software.  So far they haven't found any leverage they can use
to force the phone manufacturers or mobile carriers to provide updates.

One thing that could be argued to be a negative on Apple's part, and that
is not addressed at all in the petition, is two practices that actually
contribute to your old phone feeling slower:

1. Apple pushes out new features and security fixes for old models at
   the same time.  This means you can't choose to just avoid the features
   but keep the fixes.

2. Apple makes it hard for the average user to turn off new features to
   improve performance. I believe they do this because of their business
   philosophy that the phone experience is critically important and new
   features make the experience better.[^5]

Two interesting examples that show this behavior in action are:

- Your computer software often receives updates for a long time. This is
  generally because you paid for the software separately from the hardware
  (even if the price was bundled and you didn't know it). Sometimes the
  updates stop including features and become security only after some
  period of time until you upgrade (pay again). A great example of this
  is the Windows operating system.

- Apple has been providing their Operating System for free for
  several years.  However, there was an iPod and iPhone update released
  several years ago at the same time providing similar functionality.
  Apple provided the iPhone update for free but charged for the iPod
  update.[^6]  They did it for accounting reasons, not cost reasons.
  Again, this shows how Android and Apple are happy to provide updates
  but only Apple has enough controls in place to be able to afford to
  distribute them.[^7]

It's all about those Apps, no phone calls.

The petition and poster also missed the contributions apps make towards
a bad old phone experience.

Apps get updated constantly.  Many users have it done in the background
and don't even know the update happened.  New app features work just like
new software features.  They can often come with greater resource demands.
App authors also like to use the new features of the operating system.

Do you remember when notifications became easily available in the phone
operating systems?  You may not know when that happened in the OS,
but, when it did you suddenly noticed that every application on your
phone started notifying you constantly.  All of those notification
registrations can add up to some addition resource needs, even if only
in extra network data and power for the antenna.

### So how do I make my phone last four or more years

The only conclusions I can draw are:

1. Never accept any phone software updates.  This will cause your phone
   to slowly become more and more insecure and possibly unstable.
   This could cause you to lose your data to software crashes or hackers.

2. Never update your apps. You won't be able to paint your face for the
   Olympics in Facebook or access the newest Pokemon Go whatever they
   ares, but your phone won't slow down.  However, you may also lose the
   ability to use your apps at all.  Some application providers expect
   you to run their latest code and will block you from their service
   if you don't.

### OK, that sucks, what other option is there?

Recycle.  Make sure your phone is treated in an earth friendly way.
This means using your manufacturer's program if there is one and
petitioning them to start one if there isn't one.  In the US, a couple
of states have passed or are considering passing mandatory recycling
laws to make the manufacturers clean up the mess.  The European Union
is considering similar legislation.

However, make sure the manufacturer isn't just dumping the phones
somewhere to hide them.  Many places in south east Asia and Africa have
become dumping grounds for materials needing recycling.  The work is
unsupervised and done in a way that often destroys the local environment
or is harmful to the workers.  To see how this has happened in another
industry do an Internet image search for "ship breaking."

Wow, that turned out to be much longer than I expected.  I hope it
was useful.

[^0]: Companies and people are generally not evil and out to get you.
      Companies and people often act in their own best interest, but
      this isn't always evil.  Evil is motivated.  Evil is generally
      demonstrated by repeated actions and behaviors, i.e. constant hate
      speech about different groups coupled with calls to attach or
      kill someone.  Just because someone or a company does something
      you don't like that doesn't mean they are evil.  This is also
      fodder for another blog post.

[^1]: In my opinion, if your cause is centered around an Internet
      petition, you're probably not doing anything but making noise.

[^2]: Yeah, it is a bad example, but I was tired.  Also, baking apparently
      is very very exacting.  A better example would probably be about
      anti-vaxxers but that is a can of stupid I don't have time to
      crack open.

[^3]: The poster noted in a comment that her Android phone had not
      received a single software update in four years.

[^4]: This is a slight simplification.  Also, some Android phone makers do
      provide updates, but as I understand none have done it consistently
      or across their entire product line.

[^5]: On iOS you can enable *Low Power Mode* which has a side effect
      of turning off a lot of "unnecessary" resource draining features.
      I suspect there is a similar setting for Android.  However, your
      mileage may vary, so experiment.  In my personal use, I find it
      extends the battery life significantly and reduces my data usage
      to a trickle.  I do find myself missing some the features that are
      turned off like many push notifications and animation prettiness.

[^6]: http://www.macworld.com/article/1131991/ipodtouch.html This wasn't
      the example I was thinking of at first.  I remembered something
      about a network driver or something similar for Mac OS X that cost
      $3 because of a similar accounting issue.

[^7]: This is also a simplification. Some people argue that part of
      Apple's motivation is to keep their ecosystem from fragmenting
      which helps the Apps side of the house.
