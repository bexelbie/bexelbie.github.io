# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- [Participated](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2017/04/community-managers-sit-everywhere-should-they/) in the second week of the opensource.com blogging challenge.  If you missed the first week post it is [here](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2017/04/onboarding-new-contributors-in-the-fedora-project/).  You should definitely participate in the future weeks!
- The new [budget](https://budget.fedoraproject.org/) website for Fedora is live!  I need to write an announcement.  I also need to work with Fedora-Infrastructure to get more of the building automated.  If you want to help, ping me.
- An amazing [meeting](https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-flock/2017-04-19/regcfp_flock_2017.2017-04-19-14.09.html) with [mizmo](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Duffy), [puiterwijk](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Puiterwijk), and [stickster](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pfrields?rd=User:Stickster) to plan the changes needed to [regcfp](https://github.com/puiterwijk/regcfp) and other details for Flock.
- Finalized the GSoC Fedora selections for 2017 (due a bit after this post goes live).  Students get notified in May, not before - thems the rules from the Googles!

# A la Mode

I also made some personal progress doing:

- More work on my taxes and begining to re-evaluate my understanding of how the Czech Republic views my financial life. Taxes for two countries ain't easy.
- Upgraded from F24 to F25 ... I know I am late to the party.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Back to Beantown (Boston, MA USA) for Red Hat Summit from 2-5 May.  If you're in the neighborhood, you know the deal.
- Community Leadership Summit in Austin, TX from 6-7 May and OSCON is also in Austin, TX from 8-12 May. I may have to leave on 12 May early for ...
- OSCAL in Tirana, Albania from 13-14 has accepted a talk proposal from me (eep!) so definitely come and give me some audience love.
