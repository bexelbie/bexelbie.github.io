# A slice of cake

Last week as the FCAIC I:

- lots of paperwork that never feels like anything individually as I prepare for some away from internet time. 
- meetings about search engine rank and relevance - turns out we have more than we thought at docs.fp.o
- preparation for both my vacation and the two immediately upcoming conferences.

# Ã€ la mode

- got a haircut - if you've seen me recently you know how important this is.
- wrote some patches for AsciiBinder

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.
