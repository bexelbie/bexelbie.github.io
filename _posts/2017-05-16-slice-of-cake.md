# A slice of cake

I've been on the road for the last two weeks, so this piece of cake is like a finally getting a slice of Grandma's special Tuesday surprise cake after a long trip away from home.

Last week (and the week before) as FCAIC I:

- Attended [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2017) and worked the booth talking about Fedora Modularity, 3D printing and other fun stuff.
- Attended the [Community Leadership Summit](https://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/), an unconference style event with great keynotes and participant driven conversations about communities.  I walked away with some great ideas I hope you'll see soon.
- Attended [GrimoireCon North America](https://grimoirelab.github.io/con/), a day long series of presentations by the developers and some users of [Grimoire Lab](https://grimoirelab.github.io/).  This looks like a potential platform for metrics related to Fedora.  It is used by some other communities with various levels of success.
- Attended the first day of [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx) and worked the booth talking about Fedora and watching people try to convince us that [Thomas Cameron's car](https://twitter.com/bexelbie/status/862023857393283072) should be given to them as swag.
- Attended and [presented](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie-talks-demos/tree/master/OSCAL.2017.Dont.Write.It.All) at [OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/), an Open Source conference by the folks at [Open Labs](https://openlabs.cc/en/).

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Open Source Summit in Tokyo, Japan from 31 May - 2 June.
- LinuxCon in Beijing, China from 19-20 June where I am helping to host the Fedora/CentOS/EPEL Birds of a Feather.
- Working from Gdansk, Poland from 3-4 July.
- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
