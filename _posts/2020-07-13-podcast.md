> What the world needs is another podcast .. and a really good 5 cent coffee.

Challenge Accepted, for the podcast bit!

Adam, Patrick and I are giving podcasting a whirl.  We have started [Fractal FM](https://fractal.fm/).

We were already regularly talking about a variety of tech and life topics already and have decided to invite the world into the discussion.  We've published our first episode and I hope you'll [give it a listen](https://fractal.fm/1).

For those of you wondering, we don't directly tackle the 5 cent coffee, but we do discuss coffee.
