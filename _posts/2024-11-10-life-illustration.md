Wow - I hadn't realized I have written nothing this whole year.  I have had a lot going on:

- The kid keeps getting bigger
- I changed jobs
- I wrote two phone apps and got one published
- I basically broke up with social media but failed to start writing here (like a lot of folks)

In lieu of more details, I saw a LinkedIn post that alerted me to what an apparent X trend, you ask ChatGPT 4-o, “Based on everything you know about me, draw a picture of what you think my current life looks like.”

This is what it generated for me ...

... and the prompt it sent to the image generator:

"A dynamic scene illustrating a day in the life of a product manager with a strong focus on open-source strategy and cross-functional leadership. The setting includes a modern workspace with a laptop open to code collaboration software, strategic planning boards, and notes about community contributions and partnerships. The scene has subtle Japanese decor elements reflecting cultural engagement, and symbols of technology, leadership, and creative projects are visible. A framed map or images of Korea and Japan show the user's cultural connections, while a novel draft and creative brainstorming tools for a Lambda function project hint at active side projects. The background features both cityscape and green space for balance. Lighting is warm, creating a sense of productivity and introspection."
