# A slice of cake

Last week as FCAIC I:

- Contributing toward the streamlining of getting content on the [Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/) along with many others in CommOps.
- OMG the financials.  They never end.  An entire day of reporting done :).
- Lots of little cleanups and meetings before travel, including getting this slice of cake posted.  You probably won't hear from me for a few weeks.
- Attended my first [Fedora Readiness Meeting](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Readiness_Meetings) for docs and earned the snazzy [readiness badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/readiness).

# A la Mode

- I attended an [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.org/) training to learn more about this PAAS platform.  I also hope this will help me with an exam to extend my [RHCE](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhce) which expires soon.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling to:

- Open Source Summit in Tokyo, Japan from 31 May - 2 June.
- I'll be on vacation/holiday the week of 5 June.
- LinuxCon in Beijing, China from 19-20 June where I am helping to host the Fedora/CentOS/EPEL Birds of a Feather.
- Working from Gdansk, Poland from 3-4 July.
- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
