# A slice of cake

In the last week as FCAIC I:

- Welcomed a new member of the team.  [Kristýna Jandová](https://twitter.com/MrsTuxie) has started as a community intern in Brno.  While she isn't full-time on Fedora, I intend to monopolize her time.
- Worked with Kristýna to get bus tickets emailed to most funded Flock travelers.  Round II is still being worked on.
- Resolved more Flock issues :)
- The big blocker bug for the new Fedora Docs site, broken cross references, is scripted out by [Robert Kratky](https://twitter.com/rkratky).  This should allow the site to move forward.

# À la mode

- Visited the Slovak Paradise, [Slovenský Raj](http://www.slovenskyraj.eu/).  While there I hiked through the meandering paths of 2.5 books, waded through three bowls of garlic soup, and forded 2 plates of Bryndzové halušky.  I was also forced to drink iced coffee with caramel on top, like an animal.  Others in the party went hiking.  I understand it was nice and without caramel on top.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
