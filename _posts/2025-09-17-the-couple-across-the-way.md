excerpt: "A whimsical moment observing a retired couple's daily ritual and a surprise silly hat." 
---

From my window and balcony, I can see the balcony of a couple who live across the way. They seem to be about 10 to 15 years older than me, and I gather from their habits that they’re both retired. Several times a day, they step out onto their balcony with cups of coffee. One of them is often on the phone, while the other might sit quietly. Their voices are distinctive, so if my window is open, I always hear them.

They say you shouldn’t make up stories about people you observe and expect them to be true. It’s like assuming someone’s Instagram reflects their real life. But because I work from home, I see this couple frequently, and I think it’s lovely that they have this time, this space, and this ritual.

I often wonder what they’re saying—either to each other or to the person on the phone. My Czech isn’t strong enough to understand much, so I can’t piece together their conversations. I’ve never asked a Czech-speaking friend to listen in, either. If I did, I suspect I’d hear complaints, as I’ve been told that Czechs are prone to complaining. But one of the perks of not speaking the language fluently is that I can imagine otherwise. When I walk down the street, I assume people are talking about how beautiful the day is and how lucky we are to live in this city, rather than airing grievances.

What prompted me to write this today is that, for the first time, I noticed the woman wearing what I can only describe as a silly hat. She’s never worn a hat before, at least not that I’ve noticed. The man occasionally wears a baseball cap, but this was different. It made me wonder: is today silly hat day? If so, I hope it’s a happy one.
