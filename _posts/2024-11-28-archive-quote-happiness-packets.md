As part of evolving this site to better reflect my current priorities, I am archiving two pages: **Rarely Quotable** and **Happiness Packets**. Both pages served meaningful purposes when I created them, but over time, their relevance and active role here have diminished. 

## Rarely Quotable

This page began as a lighthearted acknowledgment of moments when my words were quoted in articles or publications. At the time, I found it validating and worth celebrating. However, as I've progressed in my career, I've found that being quoted, while nice, no longer defines my sense of accomplishment or happiness. Additionally, I haven't kept up with maintaining the page, and it feels less central to who I am now. 

While the archived quotes remain here, I see this as part of embracing a more grounded approach to my work and how I reflect on it publicly.

## Happiness Packets

This page was originally a way to archive the happiness packets I received or sent as messages of appreciation and encouragement through the [Happiness Packets project](https://www.happinesspackets.io/). I admired the project and hoped it would grow into a widespread tradition of sharing gratitude within open-source communities.

While I still value the spirit of the project, it seems to have transitioned into an archival state itself. I don’t anticipate sending or receiving more happiness packets, and maintaining this page has become less relevant. I remain deeply appreciative of the kind words shared with me, and this archive preserves that appreciation while closing the chapter on an active role for the page.

## Why Archive?

Archiving these pages isn't about erasing the past but about acknowledging that their time has passed. By redirecting the old URLs here, I hope to honor the reasons these pages existed while moving forward with a more focused site. 

## Archived Content

### Rarely Quotable

**Original Introduction:**  
This page is pure vanity. You should really click away right now. I am not quoted all that often which is fine with me. But ... if you have it, flaunt it.

### Happiness Packets

**Original Introduction:**  
I tend to believe that anonymity is important to offer and preserve.  I also think we should try to be as open as possible and to own our successes and our misses.  I don't delete writing I am not proud of, though I do reserve the right to add clarifying notes and context.

In the same spirit, I am going to list these here.  Along those lines, I am not listing packets I have sent as the recipient can choose whether they are published or not.

Even if it's part of your day job, the passion you put into your work and the Fedora community really stands out. Looking at how Flock planning has happened this year, everything seems a little more organized than before as far as communication goes. While I know you'd argue that it's a team effort and a lot of folks are involved, I know that you yourself have not played a small role in this.

I really appreciate all of this work that you're doing and putting into the Fedora community. It really shows and has an impact on the day-to-day open source lives of so many other contributors. Thanks for everything you do. I'm happy we have people like you in our community.

**Friday April 14, 2017 - You received a Happiness Packet from Rafal Luzynski (digitalfreak@lingonborough.com).**

<img alt="Happiness Packets logo" width="200" height="200" src="/img/happiness-packet-envelope-square.png" align="right" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="5"/>Thank you for being such a crazy guy and having this idea to bring 200 other the same crazy gals and guys straight into my neighborhood to make the greatest Open Source conference in the world.<br clear="right"/>

**Tuesday April 11, 2017 - You received a Happiness Packet from Amita (amsharma@redhat.com).**

<img alt="Happiness Packets logo" width="200" height="200" src="/img/happiness-packet-envelope-square.png" align="left" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="5"/>Honestly Bex, your first impression was not so good for me. I thought you are way too straight forward. But more I started working with you in Open Source world, more I started understanding your work style. You are an amazing contributor who is capable of addressing very challenging issues in Open Source and Fedora. With your great amount of knowledge and fast learning capabilities, within a short amount of time, you have not left any area of Fedora untouched. I see you handling very hot topics with an ease in different Fedora meetings. You are an awesome contributor whom I look at as a very senior and experienced person. I learn a lot from you. I wish to work with you more closely in future, under your wings in Fedora. Thanks for taking initiatives and changing things for right in Fedora. I wish more strength and power to you all the time so that you will never go away from Fedora :)<br clear="right"/>

<img alt="Happiness Packets logo" width="200" height="200" src="/img/happiness-packet-envelope-square.png" align="right" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="5"/>You have worn many hats in open source over the years, not just as a contributor, but also as a mentor. I put a lot of high value into your thought-out opinions and insights. You have a unique and open-minded way of thinking about things, in open source and personal things alike. I'm thankful that we have people like you in open source communities to build better software and also to build better communities. We're lucky to have someone like you around. Thanks for all you have done and keep on doing amazing things.<br clear="right"/>
