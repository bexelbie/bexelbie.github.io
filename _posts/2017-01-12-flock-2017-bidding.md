It is time to start the bid process for this year’s Flock.  This year we are back in North America for Flock 2017. If you’d like to help host the event in your city, it’s time to start putting together a bid.  To find out what you need to do, [read the wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flock_bid_process). Bids are due by February 28, 2017, so do not wait to start.  It takes more time than you may realize to compile all the required information for a good bid.

Tips, advice and more details are available in the original posting on on the [Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/flock-2017-bids-due-28-feb-2017/) from 12 January 2017.

# Tips and advice for Flock 2017 planning

Keep in mind that committing to help plan a conference is a lot of work and shouldn’t be approached lightly. It’s a big time commitment, and as the local contact, you’re critical to the success of the event. Flock has been held successfully on college campuses and in hotels.  We need to make sure that the space will work for both the conference and be affordable.  Details are on the wiki page.

Not sure where to begin? You can view some of the previous winning bids for past years as a reference point for building your own bid. Check out some of these for examples:

* Flock 2016: [Kraków, Poland](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flock2016-Krakow-proposal)
* Flock 2015: [Rochester, New York, USA](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flock2015-Rochester-proposal)
* Flock 2015 honorable mention: [Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flock2015-CapeCod-proposal)
* Flock 2014: [Prague, Czech Republic](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flock2014-Prague-proposal)

Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions or need help getting your bid together.  If you’re not already subscribed to the [flock-planning](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/flock-planning@lists.fedoraproject.org/) email list, you should also do so.
