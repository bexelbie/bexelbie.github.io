# A slice of cake

In the last bunch of weeks as FCAIC I[^1]:

- Failed to post my slice of cake on 21 August 2017.  If I had, it would have mentioned that I:
  - fought with a printer ... and mostly lost :(
  - worked hard on the final Flock tasks including booklet printing, last minute supplies and badge labels (see printer fight above).
  - was excited and surprised by the rapid launch of the all new [docs.fedoraproject.org](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/).  A blog post explaining the changes is coming soon[^2].
- Attended Flock.  Overall I think the conference was a success and I am excited by all of the session and general feedback people have been posting.  I know that the council has a lot to think about as we work on next year.
- Attended a bunch of meetings in Raleigh in Red Hat Tower.

# Ã€ la mode

- Was actually in the US on Labor Day for the first time in a long time.  It's still weird to work US holidays.
- Was the emcee at Write The Docs in Prague, Czech Republic.  Two days of talks and all of them introduced by me :).
