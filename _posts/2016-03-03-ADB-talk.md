I had the opportunity to present two demonstrations of the [Atomic
Developer Bundle (ADB)](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle)
with my colleague, [Navid Shaikh](https://twitter.com/swordphilic)
twice in the same week.  The ADB is a Linux container development
environment being developed as part of [Project
Atomic](https://projectatomic.io).

Our first audience was to members of the [CentOS](http://www.centos.org)
community in Brussels at the
[CentOS Dojo](https://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2016)
on 29 January 2016.  This talk was mostly to system administrators
and people looking for production ready solutions.

The second presentation was to the mostly development-oriented
audience of [DevConf.cz 2016](http://devconf.cz/) on 6 February 2016.
This audience, heavily drawn from the [Red Hat](https://community.redhat.com) and
[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) communities is focused on
development strategies.

If you're not familiar with the ADB, it is a platform for developing
container based applications.  Today, it is still in the early
stages and the upcoming 2.0 release is focused on some core goals:

* Provide an environment for Linux container development for all
  major development platforms, Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and
  Linux.

* Provide an easy way for developers to setup a production mimicking
  environment without having to learn how to install or setup the
  components that make up production.

* Enable the full use of the developer's preferred toolset, not
  just Linux or CLI tools.

* Utilize only Free and Open Source software

Reading these you're probably thinking, "Woo! You built a Virtual
Machine that has docker in it. That is not new."  In some ways,
you're right, but I believe there are two areas where we are providing
new and significant value.

First, while we are opinionated about how to build containers, we
aren't closed minded.  We are not trying to force you down a
particular path or toward using only a specific set of technology.
To that end we ship with 4 different container orchestration options
today and more can easily be added.

Another significant differentiator is that
our team is really focused on making sure that non-Linux users are
still first-class citizens (or depending on your view point that
Linux users aren't forgotten).  This means we are designing the ADB
to be platform agnostic and to operate the same way everywhere
(including using the same technology) as much as possible.

To accomplish this, we are enabling development using the following
technology:

* Virtual Machine Delivery: [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) - a
  popular and easy way to deliver virtual machines that are easily
  configured, started, stopped, and reset in development environments.
  Many developers are using vagrant for other development workflows
  so we can leverage this momentum and knowledge.

* Virtual Machine Execution (Hypervisor): Today we are building
  images for [libvirtd](http://libvirt.org), the preferred Linux
  hypervisor, and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), the
  free cross-platform hypervisor.  As there are requests, we will
  add more.

* Linux Containers: [docker](https://www.docker.io) - currently the
  container technology with the greatest mindshare.  However, nothing
  in the box prevents other options like
  [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt) and the output of the [Open
  Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org) from being used.

* Container Orchestration: Today we support development using
  [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.org),
  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
  [Mesos-Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), and
  native docker.  We aren't just shipping binaries though.  Each
  orchestrator, where appropriate, comes pre-configured and ready
  to run.  If you're writing an OpenShift application, you don't
  need to learn how to setup OpenShift.  With one command a single
  node set up is running.  The same holds true for the other
  orchestrators.

* Host Enablement:
  [vagrant-service-manager](https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/)
  is a vagrant plugin being developed in conjunction with the ADB.
  This plugin enables easy environment setup to enable CLI and IDE
  tools on the workstation to interact with the ADB.  Now you can
  treat the whole setup as a "black box" and just interact with the
  services, much like you would with production.

* Tools, tools, tools: The box includes the [atomic CLI](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic)
  which provides many missing container management functions or
  eases execution.  Also the box is ready to support multi-container
  applications specified with
  [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and built
  with [Atomic App](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp).

Both talks were rewarding and led to great conversations afterward
in the "hallway track."  I am looking forward to following up with
some potential users in India.  Also, at the CentOS Dojo, it became
clear that there is a system administrator use case that merits
some more exploration.

I am grateful to have had the chance to speak with Navid and for
being given the opportunity to speak by the organizers of both the
CentOS Dojo and DevConf.cz 2016[^1].

[^1]: I was a volunteer at DevConf.cz 2016, however I had nothing to do with the talk selection or scheduling committees.  The extent of my participation with the schedule was ensuring that it printed correctly in the program and on the various navigational signs.
