# A slice of cake

In the last two weeks as FCAIC I:

- Continued working on Flock, including organizing the budget so we could get some vendor approvals done.  If you're interested in tracking the progress, keep an eye on the [flock-planning](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/flock-planning@lists.fedoraproject.org/) email list.
- Attended LinuxCon Beijing - an event report is in the queue, I promise!
- Attended the Education Day held by the Red Hat Beijing office.  This exciting event will also get an event report but represented a great way to meet with potential members of the Fedora Community in Beijing.

# A la Mode

- Hahahaha with as much time as I spent in planes and stuck in airports I didn't get to do anything for me.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.

- Working from Gdansk, Poland from 3-4 July.  Wanna get a coffee?  We can pretend I am practicing my Polish!
- LATAM Organizational FAD from 13-15 July in Cusco, Peru.
- Flock on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 29 August - 1 September.
