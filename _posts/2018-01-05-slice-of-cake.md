# A slice of cake

Last week as the FCAIC I:

- Lamented the fact that I hadn't written an update since September 2017.  Ok, I didn't really do that last week, I've been feeling bad about it for much longer than that.
- Did a bit of finance work including chasing down a missing airfare receipt.  The world needs a better way of funneling receipts to systems that doesn't involve my email and cut/paste.
- Taking guidance from [Matthew Miller](https://twitter.com/mattdm/status/947878506716901376) I went through all email older than 90 days and still in an inbox. I deleted most of it.  Hooray me?
- I also spent a lot of time just powering through email.  I got to less than 85 in three inboxes ... now if I could just turn off the inbound flow :D

# Ã€ la mode

- According to Duolingo I am now 18% fluent in Polish.  I never knew that 18% could also mean 0% :(.  It is hard but surmountable.
- In other Polish language news, look up the rules for declining nouns acting as direct objects in negated verb sentences.  OMG!
