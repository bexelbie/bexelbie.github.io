If you've never heard [Vaclav Pavlin](https://vpavlin.eu) speak,
you've missed out.  If you were at [Config Managment
Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) in Ghent, Belgium on 2 February 2016,
you missed out.  Vaclav was scheduled to give a talk on
[Nulecule](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/speakers/BrianExelbierd.html) and
had to cancel at the last minute.  He was kind enough to pass the
baton to me and allow me to present instead.  Warning: I rewrote
most of his talk and made it "mine" therefore errors and omissions
are mine and not his.

Nulecule, if you're not familiar with it (shame on you!), is a
multi-container application specification being written by [Project
Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/).  The specification makes it easy
to describe how an application fits together and then to distribute
it for a variety of run-time environments.  The specification also
makes it very easy to package up and manage an application and all
of its configuration across your development, test, and production
environments.

My [slides and demo
scripts](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie-talks-demos/tree/master/CfgMgmtCamp.eu.2016)
are online.  Included is my demonstration of deploying a multi-container
application via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) using what may
be the world's simplest
[playbook](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie-talks-demos/tree/master/CfgMgmtCamp.eu.2016/ansible).

I am very grateful
to the organizers of Config Management Camp for giving me the
opportunity to present.
