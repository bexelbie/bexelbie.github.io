Yes, the rumors are true. Something new has come into my life. Frankly,
I didn't think it would be that big of a deal. I certainly didn't expect
the interhoo to explode[^0].

But, yes. It arrived this morning. Like all good, decent, modern
people, the first thing I do in the morning is check my phone. I wonder
why the screen is all wonky. Then I remember I can't see and
put on my glasses. Then I check my phone again. And there it was in
huge letters. The announcement. The impending arrival. It was
beautiful.

I know this is hard to believe, but it happened. I got a new UPC cable
modem! I was shocked, too. I only called them to try and get them to 
lower my bill by 50 CZK[^1] a few days ago. I succeeded and on
top of that got a new modem with... wait for it... WIFI!  Boo-yah and
welcome to the big leagues, baby!

![No, it isn't a cheese grater.](/img/2016/newhotness/modem.jpg) No, I didn't get a fly new speaker.

As an added bonus, the modem comes with a weird form of old-timey media
that is doubly-unreadable. As you may know, I don't really speak Czech,
therefore, reading the label is right out. But I also no longer own an
optical reader, therefore reading the content is also right out.

![Worst. Gift. Evar.](/img/2016/newhotness/cd.jpg) Save 10 CZK and stop distributing this!

In other news, you may also have heard that I am going to be the next
[Fedora Community Action and Impact
Coordinator](https://fedoramagazine.org/welcoming-new-fedora-community-coordinator/).
I am super-excited to be taking on this new challenge and can't wait
to get started on 3 October. I'll write more about it later. If you're
going to be around LinuxCon EU in Berlin, stop and say 'hi.'

What about the cake?
{:.quote}

Oh yeah, about the cake. The new role's title is quite a mouthful.
I don't really know what to do about it other than to abbreviate it.
That makes it **FCaIC**. I am choosing to pronounce it as *F-cake.*
I love my new role and I love dessert[^2]. I get to have my "cake"
and eat it too!

PS: If you're wondering why these pictures are rotated, you're not
alone. Something in the CSS seems to be doing it, so perhaps one day
I'll go find it. PRs are welcome :).

[^0]: For very specific definitions of 'explode.'

[^1]: OK, in reality I called them over a week ago and got told that no one speaks English and that I'd be called back. Then I submitted a webform and answered emails. Then I got a call in halting English and the 50 CZK discount. Then I got another call in Czech from a very nervous woman trying to get me to understand I had to be home to get the new modem.

[^2]: I would love some soft-batch chocolate chip cookies right now. I miss those!
