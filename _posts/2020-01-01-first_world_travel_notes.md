Traveling, especially alone, gives you lots of time to observe the world and see many "first world" problems:

1. James Taylor's opus, "Sittin' By the Dock of the Bay," while catchy, is not appropriate plane boarding music. 

2. Airlines have lots of options with recorded safety briefings. The animated ones are the most disturbing and funny. The live action plus CGI ones are the most captivating.

3. If your doing your safety briefing in more than two languages it is definitely time to start being more choosy. In flight announcements in three languages are obnoxious no matter how you do it.

    If you are making announcements in only two languages, your primary working language and a second language, have the same person make both announcements back to back.  Hearing the English language announcement on Emirates and knowing the one person who speaks Arabic will be making an announcement with just enough of a delay to cause your movie to pause twice and skip a section is aggravating.

4. Making a ton of announcements about how you don't make announcements is self-defeating. If you're going to play the "quiet airport" game, use signs. 

The usual rants about bad airport signage, extra BS security screening and security theater, lack of free wifi or BS limits on it, and unprepared people have been deliberately omitted.
