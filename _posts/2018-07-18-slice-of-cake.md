# A slice of cake

<img alt="Cake Badge" width="200" height="200" src="/img/cake-with-the-fcaic.png" align="left" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="5"/>Last week as the FCAIC I:

- Handed off the driving work behind the migration of [Fedora Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org) to [Antora](https://antora.org) to [Adam Samalik](https://twitter.com/adsamalik).  I am super excited to be helping on this project and no longer trying to lead it (and becoming a blocker/cookie licker).  He has a plan in place to be live by 1 August, 2018 which is way sooner than I could have gotten there.  This is gonna be awesome.  If you're a docs contributor or a provider of docs published on the docs site, look for his email coming soon.  I plan to continue to help drive the localization effort until it is at a place where I can hand that off too.
- Lots of Flock things got done:
  - Flock's draft schedule has been created and with the CfP committee for review.  I hope to publish it next week.
  - Flock funded travel is complete.  I realized I haven't gotten my own transportation to Dresden squared away yet though ... doh!
  - Flock's bill payments are already in full swing.  I've learned a lot about VAT and we are only getting started.
- In other docs news, I am in the process of transferring what is left of my content driving docs responsibilities as well.  Petr Bokoc and I need to have another conversation to complete the hand off.  I have definitely not been able to put the time in on this like I would like, so I am super happy to have Petr stepping up.


# Ã€ la mode

- I cleaned up my personal to-do list and bookmarks.  It was a bit like [rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rearrange_the_deck_chairs_on_the_Titanic) but I hope will have some lasting impact.

# Cake Around the World

I'll be traveling some and hope you'll ping me for coffee if you're nearby.  If your considering attending and want to collaborate on a talk, let's ... talk :).

- Flock from 8-11 August in Dresden, Germany
- DevConf.us from 17-19 August in Boston, MA, USA
- Open Source Summit Europe (OSS Europe) from 22-24 October in Edinburgh, United Kingdom

Note: My attendance at a few of the events is still tentative, but I expect most will happen.
