I have finally finished a, probably way too long,
[proposal](https://www.winglemeyer.org/fedora_docs_proposal/latest/proposal/overview.html
) for implementing a new Fedora Docs publishing toolchain using
[AsciiBinder](http://www.asciibinder.org/).

The proposal, also published using AsciiBinder, suggests that we
definitively adopt AsciiDoc and convert our DocBook sources to it
without delay.  Further we should begin publishing with AsciiBinder,
ideally by Fedora 26.

The proposal tries to summarize the current state of affairs, define
the problems being solved and provides instructions for using a proof
of concept technology build to play with the tools.

Please take a read on the full proposal here: [https://www.winglemeyer.org/fedora_docs_proposal/latest/proposal/overview.html](https://www.winglemeyer.org/fedora_docs_proposal/latest/proposal/overview.html)
