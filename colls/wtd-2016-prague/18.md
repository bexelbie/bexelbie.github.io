Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs
Europe 2016 in Prague.  This is part of a [series I wrote during the
conference](/technology/2016/09/20/wtd.html).  This is not meant to be

# Docs as Code: The Missing Manual

by [Margaret Ecker](https://twitter.com/meker) and [Jennifer
Rondeau](https://twitter.com/bradamante)

> Starting a docs project, or any project is often like exploring forest,
we are eager to go forward and explore but we may not have a plan.

Docs as code is not new, but there is elaboration that needs to be done
to make this a bridge building that exposes the trees more (and mixes
the metaphors :D).

Anne Gentle suggests that Docs as Code means:

* Web delivery
* CI for docs
* Collaboration on docs uses code systems
* CMS using code systems

To this Margaret and Jennifer add:

* Docs in a repository together, with or close to the code
* Lightweight plain text markup language
* Build to HTML using static site generators or doc generators
* Multiple stakeholders
* Iterative assumptions and an agile development model

## How do we get there?

### Release Planning

Doc requirements, like other components are driven by user stories.
This is not a surprise and allows some scoping.  In a lot of cases the
assumption is that all the changes will be quick updates.  However,
in many cases you have a new audience, new features, or a new product
or service.  This assumption that all of the work is just quick updates
is why you wind up at the end of the project with a huge manual or help
system to write.  This is a failure to scope.

### Design Phase

During the design phase there needs to be additional work that resembles
planning.  Consider the types of docs required, content model, content
type templates and deployment models.

### Development Phase

Work during the development phase is going to require a doc development
environment setup.  It is assumed you've solved source formats,
source storage, content models and templates, contributor collateral,
and training.

#### Develop Content

* Research
* Outline
* Write
* Submit (commit -> automatic build -> deploy to staging)

Before this though, the proper docs development environment will allows
developers to do a brain dump and give doc pieces for further elaboration
by writers.

#### Testing

A significant gap is in testing.  Code tends to write tests first.
Documentation testing tends to be manual and is limited to language.
Reviews are usually done manually via a PR process.

## It Is Not All Easy

No matter how many templates or models you have, the blank page is scary.
We need guidelines that remind people not to be afraid of this page.
This will never be what is actually built and deployed.  This is
particularly useful to remind developers.

Docs as code by itself doesn't guarantee the delivery of high quality
docs.  But it does enable a shared vocabulary and work flow with all
potential contributors.  Even just this change sets us up for greater
success.
