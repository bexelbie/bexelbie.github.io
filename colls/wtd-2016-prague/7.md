# Information Micro-Architecture: Grammar, Syntax, and Cognitive Rhetoric

by [Rory Tanner](https://twitter.com/roringtonj) (15 minute talk)

Our discipline is acquainted with the challenges of taking a large chunk
of information and making it usable.  We know about the basic work of
information architecture: categories, structures, hierarchies, etc.

The polar bear book by O'Reilly, _Information Architecture: For the web
and beyond_ is a book most of us have read.

In short, we are comfortable with information architecture at a higher
level.  Rory believes that great things can happen when these principles
are applied at a lower level.

Last year, his employer, Shopify, published statistics that surprised
him.  He found out that users of his docs spent decades of time, in
aggregate, reading the docs.  This quantity of time reminded him of
long running computer programs.  Do we have a performance problem?
Is the documentation's "code" sub-optimal for the human brain?

## How does reading work?

Put very simply, syntax is really important and ambiguity slows down
processing time. If syntax is important and ambiguity is a blocker,
what patterns, information micro-architectures, are important.

### Examples

He provided some simple examples focused on conditionals.

**If you need help, read the docs.**

There are two parts to this sentence, the condition and the outcome.
This can be initially and partially processed as a series of verbs.
This is a temporary ambiguity.

Adding "then", as in "If you need help, _then_ read the docs." allows
the brain to unambiguously read the sentence.

**If you need help, read the docs or call support.**

Again, this has a very small, temporary ambiguity.  Again, though, this
could be, in this case three, elements in a series.  Again, adding "then"
eases the cognitive workload.

**If you use single quotes, double quotes or ampersands inside your
product tags, grouped filtering will not work as expected.**

The user is going to have temporary ambiguity after the first comma
and start to try to make the next phrase the outcome or "then."  This
ambiguity remains unresolved for a large part of the sentence because
the potential series also includes a large amount of parallel phrasing.

In this example, putting in "then" before "grouped filtering" can
eliminate some but not all the ambiguity.  Rewriting the sentence would
really be helpful.

## Thinking About Testing.

Using a concordance tool he and his colleagues found the page with the
most "ifs." Then they did A/B testing to see if adding "thens" changed
reader engagement.

Reader engagement was chosen as they believed that reduced cognitive
load would cause readers to be more likely to click through the page.
They have sufficient energy left over to do more work.

Across four tests they saw a small improvement that showed an upward
trend.  The results flirted with, or potentially were in a serious
relationship with, statistical insignificance.  However, at scale this
could still be useful.  Adding additional refactoring after considering
the micro-information architecture could really move the dial.

The goal of this talk isn't to say "use then." Instead the goal is to get
you to think about how the human brain processes. Using this knowledge
we can recognize that even at the sentence level, we need to think about
how to optimize the "code" for use on the human brain.
