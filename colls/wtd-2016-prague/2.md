Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs
Europe 2016 in Prague.  This is part of a [series I wrote during the

# Writing as a Non-Native Speaker

Steve is a student of language and a writer.  This has led to him working
in a second language, English, and furthered his love of language.
He believes that language is fascinating and the single most important
tool natural selection has given us.

To work effectively he had to develop a workflow and tools to become a
better writer in English.  He hasn't fully achieved his goals, however
he continues to grow in that direction.

## The limits of my language

The most frustrating aspect of writing as a non-native speaker is that
he cannot express himself as well as he can in his native language.
He is trapped in a cave and can't communicate.  The fewer words and
structures he has the less that he can talk about.

## Entropy

Entropy is a measure of unpredictability.  It is working against the
proper information transmission.  It is obscurity, uncertainty,
and ambiguity.  In speech we can repeat important names and phrases,
we can restate things and choose new phrases, and we can ask questions
of our partners.  In writing we do the opposite and eliminate this in
the name of redundancy.  In writing we must be as short as possible.
The shorter the less entropy.

This is a common set of mistakes, including literal translations where
there are multiple meaning options or where structure is maintained from
the first language.  This is symptomatic of the fact that languages are
not actually translatable without deficit.  Every language culture sees
the world differently and that is usually lost in translation.

## How Can we Stretch the Borders

Start with a process: Write Drunk, Edit Sober!  Just kidding, the
process actually starts with writing in a very structured manner:

1. Structure and the first draft
   1. Outline the structure of the text
   2. Estimate the word count per section to get a feel for the length
   3. Write in the flow and ignore the grammar errors. 
2. Let the draft rest
3. Edit
   1. Self-edit with no grammar checker enabled to provide focus and personal improvement.
   2. Now use various grammar checkers
   3. Read out loud to check for smoothness
   4. Send to the editor

How to stretch the borders?

1. Translation books.  It shows how to use the language.  Pick a genre
   that is like what you write.

2. Watch TV Shows.  It teaches natural language and a context for the
   foreign language free time environment.

3. Get a mentor.  This is not a teacher or helpful colleague.
   They provide strategic advice without micromanagement.  They build
   a framework.

   If you don't have a mentor, while looking read lots of personal
   development books, read blogs from lots of people not just the biggest
   influencers.  Go to real life events and meetups.  Make connections
   and build a network.

4. Keep a journal in English.  This will help you articulate your
   thoughts and achieve greater focus while providing a way to measure
   your progress.

5. Start a medium.com account or blog.  This will force you to write
   for public and build an audience.  You also have to select a topic
   and stick to it.

6. Create a strict work flow and keep it.

7. Give a presentation at Write The Docs.
