# What IKEA and Game Manuals Taught me About Technical Writing

by [Chris Ward](https://twitter.com/chrischinch) (15 minute talk)

How can we consider other fields where something is being taught and
use that to inform us as technical writers?  This could be fields like
instruction manuals in products, game designers, etc.

> A board game is a series of steps that need to be followed and understood
by the user.

This started when Chris began thinking about designing his own board
game.  He quickly realized that it needed to work, be enjoyable,
the components had to work together and the rules have to make sense.
This is a lot of detail to be conveyed to the player.  This is
surprisingly hard.  Talking to other game designers he discovered there
is also a lot math involved.

Around the same time he began to notice the large number of IKEA manuals
that have come into his life.  They also need to convey a lot of detail
and make it usable by lots of different audiences.

IKEA manuals use the interesting tactic of telling you about the parts
without unnecessary naming or identification challenges.  Complicated
game setups are often more easily explained through board setup and
motion diagrams instead of text.  The key finding is that you should
use interactivity and similar aids, especially for new users as they
can drive additional comprehension.

Board Games also showed him a path for making great docs:

* Test with people.
* If order is essential, guide users.
* Be inclusive. Think about iconography and how to eliminate text and
   translation concerns.
* Create consistent bite sized concepts.
* Don't alienate the reader with concepts that make them feel stupid.

It also showed him that he needed to:

* allow for and accept feedback.
* actually look at the feedback.
* get help with testing.
