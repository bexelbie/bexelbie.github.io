# Operations Technical Writing for Data Centers

by Joan Wendt

Operations technical writing encompasses documentation targeting people
bring up equipment and technology in huge data centers.  This is more than
just racking a new machine. This is everything big and everything small.
Yes, even every single screw, nut and bolt.  Joan started us off with
a video tour of a data center to give a sense of scale of the work.

The work is very specialized and both hard to hire for and hard to train
for.  There is typically a very long ramp up time to get started.  This is
true even for people transferring from the same role at another company.
Because of the high level of confidentiality in how things are set up,
it is generally not possible to.  't study ahead for the interview or
your first day.  This role remains relevant because company's like Google
are still innovating in these areas and constantly upgrading.

Joan's experience with tech writing started with user docs.  After 21
years she moved to platform writing to challenge herself and enter a
new phase of her career.

## What they document:

* construction site prep
* assembly of complex components
* installation
* testing
* maintenance
* repair
* decommissioning

As an example, if you worked for a utility company that laid conduit,
you would be in the field documenting the process. This involves taking
pictures, taking notes, listening to conversations and questions and
asking your own questions.  You need to document everything from how the
hole is dug to how the welds are done.  In a data center they document
things like facility infrastructure (power, cooling, etc.) and cable
routing and management.

Therefore they work on site and document, take photos, screenshots and
code samples.  She works with engineers from the beginning even with just
CAD drawings.  If the thing to be documented is small enough, they will
go into a lab and do a proof of concept build to test out the process
so she can draft a document.  Drafts at this point typically involve a
lot of photo editing to make simulate the full install.

Once the build is started she stands with an engineer and a foreman as
they do the actual work.  She will have them test her draft, if it is
ready, while the engineer trains the foreman on the process.  Afterward,
she rushes to build a new draft and return to the field to test it with
the audience.  Then the doc is finished and published.  At this point
the component can be built at scale.

## How are the Docs structured

* mostly stepped procedures
* heavy on best practices, tips and gotchas
* value is measured in functional quality.  Clarity trumps formatting,
  prettiness and other standard technical writing practices
  * text is concise to the point, often excluding definite an indefinite
    articles
  * there are no superfluous introductory texts for procedures
  * style guides are only for project specific terms and acronyms
  * formatting is not a focus as the documents are only for internal
    audiences

## Photos are the Killer Feature

Every step needs perfectly precise and detailed photographs.
This typically means that there be photos that show a:

* bird's eye view
* worm's eye view
* the front
* the back
* the inside
* the outside

This means there is a lot of climbing, stooping, an contorting to fit
into places to take a photo.

Often you have to ask an engineer or installer to undo and then redo a
process so every step can be photographed.

If the process changes every following step must be rephotographed
so that only the accepted, single, clean procedure is photographed.
There can be no evidence of earlier missteps.

## Challenges

A big challenge is that she has to be in the environment.  This can mean
going up 40 feet to a ceiling, riding a scissor lift, wearing harnesses,
being tied to a piece of equipment with a safety line, wearing safety
vests, steel toe boots, hard harts, etc.  Sometimes it is easy and you
just need anti static heel straps and an anti-static-smock.

The SMEs are often sharing tribal knowledge and have no idea how to
think about answering questions.  They say phrases that need to be teased
out into knowledge.

Ultimately, these docs are critical.  The projects being documented
can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and safety failures can kill
someone if they do something in a bad way.
