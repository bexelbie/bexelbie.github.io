Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs
Europe 2016 in Prague.  This is part of a [series I wrote during the
conference](/technology/2016/09/20/wtd.html).  This is not meant to be

# Feedback Handling, Community Wrangling, Panhandling

The context of this conversation is the large documentation project for
the Mozilla Developer Network.

## Feedback Mechanisms

How do you collect feedback from your community?  There are lots of
options each with their own pros and cons.

* Email

  Pros:

  * old school
  * ubiquitous
  * you can share a lot
  * easy to funnel and separate
  * community involvement is easy

  Cons:

  * it is not sexy
  * often slips into one-to-one conversations
  * it can take you away from the docs (it is separated from the docs and can be disruptive)

* IRC/Live Chat

  Pros:

  * synchronous communication is useful for immediate help
  * leads to rapid fixes
  * nice to talk to real people
  * strike up a relationships
  * community involvement is easy

  Cons:

  * sharing is more difficult
  * not persistent
  * IRC seen as archaic and geeky
  * harder to filter or scale

* Forums (talk pages and wiki discussion pages)

  Pros:

  * closer to the docs
  * good for sharing lots of information
  * lower effort than sync
  * maintains history

  Cons:

  * require constant curation to avoid rot
  * can turn into documentation
  * can be harder to search, especially within conversations

* Social Media

  Pros:

  * low effort and pressure
  * high coverage and engagement
  * great for marketing and promotion
  * can be great for quickfire asks

  Cons:

  * not good for conversation or contributions (structure is really not present)
  * focus can shift quickly
  * can be low signal to noise
  * can become toxic, often quickly

* Issue Trackers

  Pros:

  * great for sharing details
  * conversations
  * community involvement
  * has search and history
  * information rot not as problematic (things get closed)

  Cons:

  * can pull you away from the docs
  * can be intimidating to non-techies
  * requires engineering overhead and can be overkill

* Community Events

  Pros:

  * great for making relationships
  * great for deep understanding
  * high quality feedback
  * high signal to noise

  Cons:

  * costly
  * time consuming
  * digesting everything is scary

* Automated Feedback

  Pros:

  * can be unintrusive especially for testing
  * very low to no ongoing effort
  * great for collecting very specific data
 
  Cons:

  * not useful for other types of data
  * initial engineering overhead
  * lack of contribution or relationships

## Enter the Mozilla Developer Network

MDN is documenting the web platform and Mozilla internals.  They have
a paid writing team of 6 and a global volunteer community of 1000
monthly contributors.  They get 4.5 million readers per month and lots
of page views.

Some stuff works:

* mailing lists
* IRC
* Bugzilla
* A/B tests and quickfire questions
* social media

Some stuff hasn't worked:

* comments on pages
* talk pages
* separate forums
* other separate channels like Reddit

The theme of the stuff that doesn't work is that it typically requires
curation and/or is located in another "place."

## Responding to Feedback

The workflow through Mozilla can be described as a fire
hose. So. Much. Work.  Drowning in work. The result is that prioritization
is critical.

Their main collection tool is Bugzilla.  They have both their own bug
products and a keyword to drive developer bugs that need docs.

They have a roadmap of prioritized major tasks.  They also maintain
a collection of "papercuts and isolated fixes" that are grouped and
arranged into a single big bug.

## Working on Things

It is a balancing act.  Major releases and fixes get assigned to writers
and completed in sprints.  Random stuff is accomplished in spare time.
The backlog list keeps growing.

## Turning Feedback into Contributions

It is tricky!

However, it pays off.  Almost all non-English pages are worked on
by volunteers.  While over half of all volunteers make a single edit,
together the volunteers do three times the work of paid staff.

### How do you Improve Contributions

You can't just say, "It's a wiki, edit it yourself, dumbass!"  You can't
just put a big edit button.  You have to be kinder.

#### Be Nice

* Don't be too pushy
* Big tasks do not generally work with volunteers.  Make things small.
* Keep tasks granular so they don't block.
* Make it easy to find tasks (Trello, BugsAhoy, etc.)

#### Harness People's Passions

They may have a specific area of interest or technology lean, they
may have a school project (do the work and go), they may just want the
free T-shirt.  It doesn't matter why someone contributes, you want the
contribution.

#### Mentoring

Mentoring helps a lot.  Just take it slow and be realistic.  Teach the
system as needed.  Don't scare people.

#### Keep People Engaged

Communicate with them.  Hold regular meetings.  Let them know you
appreciate their work.  Consider rewards or gamification.

#### Don't Profile

There are lots of types of contributors.  Accept them all.  Reviewers and
editors, bug fixers, spam fighters, structural updaters, etc.  They all
have their place.  Spread the word to let them know you need them too.
