# Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community

by [Erik Romijn](https://twitter.com/erikpub)

## None of us are alone

Everyone he meets seems to have their entire lives together and everything
is perfect.  But, upon really getting to know them he often discovers
that many of them have serious challenges in their lives, including
depression, OCDC, and self hurting issues.  Therefore no matter how
successful or creative someone seems, they may be spending tremendous
energy just get to through the day.

> 1 in 4 people experience mental illness in their life time

25% might seem like a small percentage, but consider that 70% of office
workers regularly experience physical symptoms due to stress.  This may
not be a mental illness, however it is harmful in the long term.

Our cultures encourage us to hide these feelings.  Therefore we know that
there are people in this room that are struggling with things.  And many
of the people in this room know exactly what you are going through.

At DjangoCon 2015 attendees had the opportunity to speak to a counselor
for 25 minutes, for free, and completely anonymously.  1 in 10 attendees
used this service.  Feedback from users included:

* It is a relief to say these things to someone and have acknowledgment
   of the problem.
* I found it useful and relaxed. I don't feel like I am not crazy
   or alone.  This is normal.

By being considerate, empathetic, accepting and understanding by helping
people not feel alone we can help. We don't have to be trained mental
health professionals.

Since we are not alone or the only ones struggling what can we do:

## Help Yourself

Many people enjoy these kinds of communities and feel great when
contributing to something bigger than themselves.  This desire to
contribute causes us to take on more or to become the "rockstar" who
does everything.  This is where the problem starts as this participation
should have a positive impact not just on our peers, the community and
the world, but it should also have a positive impact on ourselves.
Putting yourself first isn't bad.  If people are depending on you,
you must be in a good place to be able to fulfill these dependencies.
Take care of yourself first, or your can't help others.  It is the same
reason that, on an airplane, you must put on your oxygen mask first,
before helping others.

## It is OK to say no (and even OK to say no more)

Why is this so hard?  Because many people are worried about a negative
response or believe this indicate they have failed.  But, saying 'no'
is required if we are going to have sustainability and not drop the ball
on our commitments.

Erik illustrated this point with a personal anecdote involving him and
a co-presenter who got too busy to do everything successfully.

> Sustainability is critical for open source and open "sourcerers".

Suffering through our own work helps no one.  Stepping down is always
feared, but in general, it is well received and understood.  When a
negative reaction occurs it is generally indicative of that person having
similar fears.  Stepping down also creates space for someone to step in
and step up.  It is like not wanting to eat the cookie you picked up
from the tray, but instead of putting it back, you lick it so that no
one else will want it either.

Another anecdote, this time about a conference party he was trying to get 
organized on top of all of his other responsibilities.
He was worried that he would be burdening his co-organizers if he
dropped out.  But he was licking the cookie because he was both making
sure that the party wasn't getting planned and preventing someone else
from doing it.

> Don't lick the cookie.

## Asking for help is not the same as failing

This talk is the direct result of Erik asking Mikey Ariel for help
turning the incoherent initial ramblings that formed the genesis of the
talk and into something worthwhile.

The real failure is if your goals never happen.  Getting help makes
goals achievable when they are bigger than you.

Ignoring your issues and sticking your head in the sand as the mythical
ostrich does, builds up over time and creates greater problems.
It may not cause mental illness, but it can destroy your life.  As this
progresses the idea of asking for help continues to be more "unrealistic".
This not asking for help can even convince you that no one wants to help.
No one is telepathic so no one actually knows what you need.

Asking for help may make you feel like people may judge or ridicule you.
This is incredibly rare and it hasn't happened in this kind of community.
If this does happen, it doesn't mean that you are wrong to ask.  It means
the other person is behaving in an inappropriate manner and is toxic
and not your friend.

Even with all of this knowledge, Erik still finds asking for help
to be challenging.  But, communities like this are a great place to
practice this.

## How Communities Can Help

In general any efforts to help a specific population feel more welcome,
helps the population overall.

Have a communication channel available in advance to help people organize
their visit and to help those who are coming alone connect.

Small signs like "Yay! you made it" help a lot.  Offer quiet rooms for
people to wind down.  Also, acknowledge issues by doing things like
helping people who may be struggling with things like alcoholism find
recovery meetings.  It isn't that this information is inaccessible.
Instead it demonstrates that the community understands this happens
and cares.

To help with over commitment the Django community has changed service
terms to 6 months with a required opt-in for continuation.  This lack
of a need to opt-out has made leaving easier.

Django is also looking at creating a well-being committee to help support
the community as a whole.  This will provide peer-support for members of
the community, not long term care. The goal is to provide the ability
to start a process.  This can help, "pop the stack", if you're familiar
with the data structure.

Another area where communities can help is by breaking down the inhibition
we generally have to giving praise.  This inhibition is oddly joined by
a general willingness to pass along negative feedback.

To this end, they have created an open source platform for sending
happiness packets.  This service allows you to anonymously send gratitude
to others and thank them for what they do. Visit happinesspackets.io
