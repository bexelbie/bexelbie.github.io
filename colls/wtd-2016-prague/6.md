Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs

# When Bad Screenshots Happen to Good Writers

by [Swapnil Ogale](https://twitter.com/swapnilogale) (15 minute talk)

Imagine you are cruising to release.  Everything is reviewed and perfect.
Then, at the last minute you need new screenshots.  You're now under the
gun to get a new feature that got pushed into the last sprint documented.
You turn to the developers and ask for help with screenshots.  What they
return with with is barely qualifying for the `jpg` standard.

## Why do we have screenshots?

Screenshots are useful when you're orienting the user in a process
or trying to provide context with the user interface. You may also be
including them to break up the text walls.

Screenshots are a necessary evil.

86% of technical writers in his small survey do their own screenshots.
This is a good thing as it implies access to the system.

Swapnil then showed a parade of bad screen shots. They were busy, blurry,
and completely devoid of information.  Why are these here?  Who reviewed
and approved these images?

What people don't understand is that screenshots are not something
we can dictate as being required for every step.  They can overwhelm
long documents.

Additionally, screenshots are an art form.  Everything from taking them
to storing them and processing them.  Screenshots often need to be
tailored for the various display modalities.

Bad screenshots can force you to retrofit your instructions to fit the
screenshots you have available.

60% of technical writers said there was nothing about screenshots in
their style guide.

## Can we fix this?

Yes.

* Put screenshot procedures in your style guide.
* Create a cheat-sheet on how to make screenshots.

Give these instructions to people who offer to help.  If they show up
with garbage, politely reject it.

Ultimately, screenshots are best when they are applied with a specific
purpose. And are taken well.
