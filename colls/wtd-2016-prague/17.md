Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs
Europe 2016 in Prague.  This is part of a [series I wrote during the
conference](/technology/2016/09/20/wtd.html).  This is not meant to be
transcriptions and may have missed points made during they talk.

# Poll the Docs

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a8EJWD-rJC7azxrNoGEFAcY2sWMGf0_k-PBX39DM7Yk/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00)

In 2015 it was suggested that information about the WTD community
should be gathered.  In 2016 Kata published a questionnaire and 100 people
responded.  This made percentages easy.

Kata used snowball sampling because it was easy. Therefore, the results
are not necessarily a representative sample.

Because this was a statistics survey presentation, I strongly encourage
you to read the slides linked above to see the content.
