Below are my notes and highlights from this session at Write The Docs
Europe 2016 in Prague.  This is part of a [series I wrote during the

# API Documentation: Exploring the Information Needs of Software Developers

by Michael Meng

Michael is spent 12 years as a technical writer and has been a university
professor for the last 4 years.  He is preparing the next generation of
technical writers. Michael presented a talk about deriving recommendations
for writing practitioners.

APIs are central to many modern software architectures and developers
are often faced with learning them, but:

* a lack adequate documentation resources is the most severe obstacle
   faced when learning a new API
* developers prefer other information sources even if the documentation
   is available
* a lot of information contained in API references tends to be of
   little value

In his study they used the JDK and .NET API references.

## Research Questions

* Which strategies do developers use to get into a new API?
* What questions come first? Second? Later?
* How do Developers use API documentation, if it is used at all?
* What do they look for?
* What quality criteria do developers apply to API docs?
* What is regarded as good or bad?

He and his partners conducted an interview and questionnaire study
to set the context.  They then performed an observation study before
drawing conclusions.

## Interview and Questionnaire

This qualitative feedback mechanism explored the research space.
Interviews were semi-structured in order to start a conversation.
They developed 45 questions on 11 themes to elicit information.
They interviewed 23 developers from various backgrounds and experience.

A follow up questionnaire to validate this data was administered to 113
participants online.

Results indicated that developers approached an API and first asked, "What
can I do with the API? What are the features?"  After this there tended
to be a mix of interest in concepts and overall ideas while others just
wanted to go straight to action and programming with handling special
use cases.

This is best expressed as two groups, "I need a global understanding of
he API" and "I am writing code and want to see code."

Follow up questions tended to be along the lines of "I work though
sample code of individual API functions" and "I want to read a getting
started guide."

The top challenges cited at this point were "wrong or incomplete docs"
and "incomprehensible docs."

When asked what they expect from good API docs, developers typically
answered:

* up to date
* complete
* includes code samples

## Observation study

After conducting the qualitative study and observational study was
conducted with the goal of confirming the other findings.  This practice
of paired studies is based on the idea that what people say they do is
not necessarily what they do.

The observational study had the developers use an unfamiliar API to
accomplish an understood task.  Through the use of eye tracking the
research team was able to observe where time was spent and how the docs
were used or not used.

The observational study revealed that:

* Developers don't read, they scan.  They tend to stop at code blocks,
   headings and links.
* Clear transparent, consistent navigation is important.
* Navigation needs to use content type, not document type as the
   classification.  Developer skip categories they aren't clear on.
* Participants always used sample code to begin developing their
   solutions.
* Powerful search is critical.
