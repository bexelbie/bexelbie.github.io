## Presented at [Flock 2024](https://fedoraproject.org/flock/) in Rochester, NY on 7 August 2024

## Talk Description

Every year the Fedora and CentOS Communities invite Red Hat to present a talk on what it is thinking about and how it considers and evaluates its participation in the Fedora and CentOS Communities. As always, Red Hat is not a monolith so this talk presents the general views of Red Hat with a focus on those opinions held by the RHEL Business Unit and Platform Engineering Department.
