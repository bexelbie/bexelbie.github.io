# [Nulecule: Packaging, Distributing & Deploying Container Applications the Cloud Way](https://lanyrd.com/2016/cfgmgmtcamp/sdxytt/)
## Presented at [Config Management Camp EU 2016](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/speakers/BrianExelbierd.html) on 2 Feb 2016

This repo contains the slides slides and files used for the talk and demo
I presented about [Nulecule](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule).

I am very grateful to my colleagues, [Tomas
Kral](https://www.twitter.com/kadel) and Michael Scherer, for their
assistance with the demos and talk.  I also want to thank [Vaclav
Pavlin](https://twitter.com/vpavlin) for having faith in me to present
when he couldn't.

## Talk Description

Currently there is no standard mechanism for creating, distributing
and deploying applications on containers. Applications that need
orchestration for multiple containers and hosts require hand-crafted
customization that is difficult to replicate and manage, not to mention
time-consuming. Nulecule is a specification for defining the packaged
contents, including metadata, dependencies and orchestration providers, of
container-based applications. Atomic App is the reference implementation
of Nulecule that provides an easy method for packaging, distributing and
running applications. This talk was original scheduled to be delivered
by Vaclav Pavlin.
