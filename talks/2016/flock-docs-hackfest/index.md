## Presented at [Flock 2016](https://flocktofedora.org) in Krakow, Poland on 4 August 2016

## Talk Description

This two part workshop/hackfest will help you impact Fedora's
Documentation in a positive way. First, we'll learn about the style, tone,
and structure of our docs. Second, we will work on open bugs and improving
docs. It's like an assisted writing clinic on steroids. Hacking can be
focused on open documentation bugs, enhancement requests, or any area that
interests you Presenters: Pete Travis (randomuser) & Brian Exelbierd (bex)
