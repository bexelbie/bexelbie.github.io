## Presented at [Flock 2016](https://flocktofedora.org) in Krakow, Poland on 3 August 2016

Co-presented with Dusty Mabe.

## Talk Description

The container "revolution" has resulted in a lot of non-Linux users
suddenly very interested in Linux containers. These developers often
can't run containers on their laptops because they are using Windows or
OS X or a janky non-Fedora Linux. Therefore there are a lot of virtual
machines getting spun up just to run containers. Additionally, many
of these developers aren't thinking about how to work with multiple
containers or orchestrate them because it is hard to set everything
up. The ADB solves these problems ... but ... ... it could not only
solve these problems, but it could solve them with FEDORA! Today there
is no Fedora version of the ADB. A Fedora ADB can be faster moving and
help developers use the latest code sooner. In this talk learn how to
build and improve the ADB so you can use it in your own work and so it
can become a tool for expanding the Fedora community. #TheFedoraADB
