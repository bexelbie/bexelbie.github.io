## Presented at [FUDCon LATAM 2016](https://fudcon-latam.org) in Puno, Peru on 12 October 2016

## Talk Description

Fedora 25 Beta shipped just before FUDCon LATAM.  Let's talk about what's
new and what to expect as we near the November GA release.  Let's also
dig a bit into a few technologies in F25 (and before).
