This repo contains the slides and files used for the talk.  The slides
are heavily based on the Fedora 25 Beta announcements.

## Talk Description

Fedora 25 Beta shipped just before FUDCon LATAM.  Let's talk about what's
new and what to expect as we near the November GA release.  Let's also
dig a bit into a few technologies in F25 (and before).
