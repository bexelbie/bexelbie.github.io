## Article Summary

As Linux turned 30, this piece examines why it became the dominant foundation for enterprise computing. The argument rests on three pillars: Linux fits its audience because the same people who tinker with open source in their spare time enter enterprise IT and naturally reach for the tools they know. Linux abstracts away the fundamentals well -- its modular kernel design lets teams perform precision surgery on their infrastructure without breaking everything. And Linux is continually evolving, backed by a critical mass of contributors and industry support that keeps it current with new standards and capabilities. Together, these traits explain why Linux is the foundation for digital transformation across virtually every industry.
