# The Secret to Keeping Your Community Strong for Decades

## Presented at [SFScon, Bozen, South Tyrol, Italy](https://www.sfscon.it/) on 10 November 2017 - [talk link](https://www.sfscon.it/talks/secret-keeping-community-strong-decades/)

This repo contains the slides and files used for the talk.

## Talk Description

Open source software communities, as well as the individuals and the companies that form them, are constantly evolving. Come learn about how the Fedora community grows, evolving its governance, mission and community while staying true to its values for over a decade. In this talk, we’ll use real-life examples of community members who have become involved in Fedora, how we empower people to grow their local communities and how we bring them together globally. We’ll cover real examples that communities are faced with and the processes they’ve evolved to deal with them, from encouraging diversity to managing regional budgets to onboarding new contributors.

**Note**: This talk description was written and coordinated by Stormy Peters while I was on vacation.  I am grateful for her help and for pushing me to do a talk I would normally have had on my "must attend!" list.
