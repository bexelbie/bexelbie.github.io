The Secret to Keeping Your Community Strong for Decades

Open source software communities, as well as the individuals and the companies that form them, are constantly evolving. Come learn about how the Fedora community grows, evolving its governance, mission and community while staying true to its values for over a decade. In this talk, we’ll use real-life examples of community members who have become involved in Fedora, how we empower people to grow their local communities and how we bring them together globally. We’ll cover real examples that communities are faced with and the processes they’ve evolved to deal with them, from encouraging diversity to managing regional budgets to onboarding new contributors.
