Talks and demos I've given, my work with the Fosdem Distributions DevRoom and various submissions to CFPs that I've made are are collected below.  When a talk includes extensive demo or code material, it is typically hosted in my in [my talk, presentation and demo archive](https://github.com/bexelbie/bexelbie-talks-demos) and only linked to below.

I've given a bunch of talks on behalf of Red Hat at Fedora's Flock and Nest conferences as well as at CentOS Dojo's and other places.  As these were me representing Red Hat strategy I have not listed them in detail below.

# Fosdem Distributions DevRoom

For several years I have worked with the [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org) Distributions Devroom.  I keep all of my materials related to CFP submissions and devrooms in my talks repo in the [fosdem](fosdem/) directory.

# CFP Submissions

This repository also contains [CFP
submissions](cfp-submissions) I have made and remembered to keep.
Some were successful, some were learning experiences.

Some slides were prepared using my own configuration of [reveal.js](tools).
