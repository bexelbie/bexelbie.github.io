# Fosdem Distributions DevRoom

For several years I have worked with the [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org) Distributions Devroom.  I keep all of my materials related to CFP submissions and devrooms in my talks repo in the [fosdem](fosdem/) directory.

# CFP Submissions

This repository also contains [CFP
submissions](cfp-submissions) I have made and remembered to keep.
Some were successful, some were learning experiences.

Some slides were prepared using my own configuration of [reveal.js](tools).
