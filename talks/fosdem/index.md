For several years I have worked with various efforts at [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org).  I keep all of my materials related to CFP submissions and devrooms here.

* [FOSDEM Distribution Dev Room @ FOSDEM 2018](2018/fosdem-2018-distribution-devroom) - A successful propsal with Brian Stinson from CentOS for FOSDEM 2018 modelled very heavily on the previous year's submission.  Additional useful information is in the [2018](2018) directory.
* [FOSDEM Distribution Dev Room @ FOSDEM 2017](2017/fosdem-2017-distribution-devroom) - A successful propsal with Brian Stinson from CentOS for FOSDEM 2017 modelled very heavily on the previous year's submission.  Additional useful information is in the [2017](2017) directory.
* [FOSDEM Project Atomic Table @ FOSDEM 2016](fosdem-2016-table-proposal-atomic) - An unsuccessful project table proposal for FOSDEM 2016.
