FOSDEM 2018 - Distributions Devroom Call for Participation

The Distributions devroom will take place Sunday 4 February 2018 at
FOSDEM, in Brussels, Belgium at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles.

For this year's distributions devroom, we want to focus on the ways that
distribution technologies can be leveraged to allow for easier
creation of a multi-verse of artifacts from single source trees. We also
want to continue to highlight the huge efforts being made in shared
environments around Build/Test/Release cycles.

We welcome submissions targeted at contributors interested in issues
unique to distributions, especially in the following topics:

- Distribution and Community collaborations, eg: how does code flow from
  developers to end users across communities, ensuring trust and code
  audibility

- Automating building software for redistribution to minimize human
  involvement, eg: bots that branch and build software, bots that
  participate as team members extending human involvement

- Cross-distribution collaboration on common issues, eg: content
  distribution, infrastructure, and documentation

- Growing distribution communities, eg: onboarding new users, helping
  new contributors learn community values and technology,  increasing
  contributor technical skills, recognizing and rewarding contribution

- Principals of Rolling Releases, Long Term Supported Releases (LTS),
  Feature gated releases, and calendar releases

- Distribution construction, installation, deployment, packaging and
  content management

- Balancing new code and active upstreams verus security updates, back
  porting and minimization of user breaking changes

- Delivering architecture independent software universally across
  architectures within the confines of distribution systems

- Effectively communicating the difference in experience across
  architectures for developers, packagers, and users

- Working with vendors and including them in the community

- The future of distributions, emerging trends and evolving user demands
  from the idea of a platform

Ideal submissions are actionable and opinionated. Submissions may
be in the form of 25 or 50 minute talks, panel sessions, round-table
discussions, or Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions.
