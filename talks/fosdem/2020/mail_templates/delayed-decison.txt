SUBJECT: Distributions Devroom Delayed Notifications
FROM: Brian Exelbierd <bex@pobox.com>

Hi,

We apologize for the delay in getting selected speakers notified for the
Distributions Devroom.  We had schedule conflicts with members of our
committee and hope to have notifications out this Friday, December 13.

At that time you will receive a notice if your talk is selected.
This email is just to let you know that we haven't forgotten about you
or your submission.

While this should not constitute an emergency on your part, your rapid
response to any notification will be helpful.  Please watch your email
on Friday.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

regards,

Brian Exelbierd for and on behalf of The Distributions Devroom Program Committee
