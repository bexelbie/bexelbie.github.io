# Fosdem 2020 Distributions Devroom Submission

## Title of Devroom: Distributions

## Elaborate description of proposed devroom(Including possible Topics):

Distributions still matter in a world filled with containers and
single-task virtual machines. Without distributions, software can
be bespoke to install and difficult to audit and manage at a large
scale. Distributions have responded to the changing nature of workloads
by specializing and become more flexible. This has kept distributions as
a critical component in the devops transformations that require assembly
piles of software into delivery vehicles ina repeatable, reliable,
and functional manner. This is the core problem that distributions have
always solved.

Every distribution is responsible for building, testing, and releasing
software as well as managing the lifecycle of each application in the
collection. Additionally, distributions do very important work in ensuring
that various versions of upstream software work well together and can
co-exist. Distributions are also, often responsible, for "de-vendoring"
upstream software so that security fixes can be applied more quickly.

For this distributions devroom, we want to focus on the ways that
distribution technologies can be leveraged or reused to ease
creation of a multi-verse of artifacts from a single source tree. We also
want to continue to highlight the huge efforts being made in shared
environments around Build/Test/Release cycles. Hot topics related to
the delivery problem as it impacts updates in terms of both size and
rollback/reliability are expected to be featured along with new solutions
being developed for containers, virtual machines, and IoT.

## Why does it fit FOSDEM?:

Far from from being just something cared about by "the old guard,"
distribution developers and maintainers are widely represented at
FOSDEM. Many attendees are involved (in one form or another) in the
distribution space, and would benefit both as a speaker or in the
audience of the devroom. Additionally, as the OpenSource community grows,
many FOSDEM attendees don't realize how much of what they rely on is
provided by distributions. This is not a platform for debate about the
merits of distribution A vs B as much as a statement about why picking
a distribution remains a critical success factor for many applications.

The talks are only part of the story, since many folks are interested in
the distributions space it's not uncommon to start a piece of software or
feature request only to find that the principal authors (or commentors)
are all in the room. Building in a dedicated space for this augments
the fantastic hallway track at FOSDEM.
