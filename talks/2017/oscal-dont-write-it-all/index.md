## Presented at [OSCAL 2017](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/) in Tirana, Albania on 13 May 2017

## Talk Description

In school we are taught to write everything. Modern applications are built on the backs of great frameworks, let's explore the process.  This talk-shop will walk students through the process of growing an idea from a seed into a full fledged application while focusing on leveraging existing frameworks and code as much as possible.  The example will be based on a proposed documentation publishing system for Fedora.  The concept grows from "Publish AsciiDoc" to have an automatically publishing container based pipeline for maintaining a documentation website.  Technologies used will mostly include: AsciiDoc, AsciiDoctor, AsciiBinder, OpenShift, and Jenkins.
